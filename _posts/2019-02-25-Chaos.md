*Note: I completed this challenge on January 12th, 2019, however I'm just now writing it up in December 2019. As such, some of the details are sparse.*

## User
To begin the enumeration process, a port scan was run against the target using `masscan`. The purpose of "this initial scan is to quickly determine which ports are open so that a more focused `nmap` scan can be performed that will target only the open ports discovered by `masscan`.

```
root@kali:~/workspace/hackthebox/Chaos# masscan -e tun0 -p 1-65535 --rate 2000 10.10.10.120

Discovered open port 110/tcp on 10.10.10.120
...
```

From `masscan`, it was revealed that a variety of TCP ports were listening for connections. Using this information, a second scan was run using `nmap` to more thoroughly examine the services listening on the discovered ports.

```

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 45.24 seconds
```

This is quite a bit of information to work with. Each service should be enumerated thoroughly before focusing in on one particular service. This is to say that an initial enumeration "sweep" should be conducted before a more thorough examiniation of any service is performed.

To begin, browsing to the `http://10.10.10.120` URL (the Apache service listening on port 80) suggests that access to the site is not permitted via the server's IP address (`10.10.10.120`). Instead, the site must be accessed via its domain name. 

![no_directip.png](/assets/images/htb/chaos/no_directip.png)

There is likely some Apache configuration in place similar to the following:

```
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName 10.10.10.120
    Redirect 403 /
    ErrorDocument 403 "Direct IP not allowed"
    DocumentRoot /dev/null/
    UseCanonicalName Off
    UserDir disabled
</VirtualHost>
```

Similarly, browsing to HTTP service listening on port 10000 displays the error shown below.

![domain_hint.png](/assets/images/htb/chaos/domain_hint.png)

This error suggests that:

1. HTTPS needs to be used to access the content on port 10000
2. The domain name is `chaos.htb`


The following command was issued on the testing system to map the `10.10.10.120` IP address to the domain name `chaos.htb`.

```
root@kali:~/workspace/hackthebox/Carrier# echo "10.10.10.120 chaos.htb" >> /etc/hosts
```

Now, browsing to `http://chaos.htb` loads a basic website. 

![chaos_htb.png](/assets/images/htb/chaos/chaos_htb.png)

A `gobuster` scan was run against `http://chaos.htb` and against `http://10.10.10.120` to enumerate directories available via the website. The example for `http://10.10.10.120` is shown below.

```
root@kali:~/workspace/hackthebox/Carrier# gobuster dir -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -u http://10.10.10.120
```

The above scan quickly discovers the `/wp` directory. This suggests the website was built with the Wordpress CMS.

Browsing to `http://10.10.10.120` shows a directory with a `wordpress/` subdirectory. Continuing on to the `wordpress/` directory leads to a page with protected content. A password is required to access the protected content.

![prot_content.png](/assets/images/htb/chaos/prot_content.png)

Clicking the "Protected: chaos" link under the "RECENT POSTS" header seen in the image above directs to a slight different password-protected page. On this page, there is some specific information about the post that includes the publishing date and the author.

![human.png](/assets/images/htb/chaos/human.png)

A little bit of guess work might lead to entering the word `human` as the password to unlock the protected content. Using `human` as a password reveals the contents of the protected post:

```
Creds for webmail :
username – ayush
password – jiujitsu
```

Looking back to the `nmap` scan, it can be seen that the open source IMAP and POP3 email server Dovecot is in use on the system (specifically on ports 143, 993, and 995). The `openssl` Linux tool was used to interact with the SSL-encrypted Dovecot service listening on TCP 993. In this case, authentication was not allowed using `telnet 10.10.10.120 143` over the unencrypted Dovecot IMAP service on port 143.

```
root@kali:~/workspace/hackthebox/Carrier# openssl s_client -crlf -connect 10.10.10.120:993
```

Once connected, the credentials found previously can be used to authenticate to the service.

*Note: When interacting with the IMAP service, a string of characters must be included before each user-issued IMAP command. The string of characters serves to identify transactions within the protocol. In the following examples, the `HTB` string will be used as the IMAP transaction ID.*

```
HTB LOGIN ayush jiujitsu
HTB OK [CAPABILITY IMAP4rev1 SASL-IR LOGIN-REFERRALS ID ENABLE IDLE SORT SORT=DISPLAY THREAD=REFERENCES THREAD=REFS THREAD=ORDEREDSUBJECT MULTIAPPEND URL-PARTIAL CATENATE UNSELECT CHILDREN NAMESPACE UIDPLUS LIST-EXTENDED I18NLEVEL=1 CONDSTORE QRESYNC ESEARCH ESORT SEARCHRES WITHIN CONTEXT=SEARCH LIST-STATUS BINARY MOVE SNIPPET=FUZZY LITERAL+ NOTIFY SPECIAL-USE] Logged in
```

Next, the IMAP `LIST` command is used to show all available mailboxes. The syntax for the `LIST` command is `LIST "<mailbox path>" "<search argument>"`.

```
HTB LIST "" "*"
* LIST (\NoInferiors \UnMarked \Drafts) "/" Drafts
* LIST (\NoInferiors \UnMarked \Sent) "/" Sent
* LIST (\HasNoChildren) "/" INBOX
HTB OK List completed (0.001 + 0.000 secs).
```

Now, the `SELECT` command is used to specify which mailbox to interact with. After searching each mailbox, only the `Drafts` mailbox contains an item.

```
HTB SELECT Drafts
* FLAGS (\Answered \Flagged \Deleted \Seen \Draft)
* OK [PERMANENTFLAGS (\Answered \Flagged \Deleted \Seen \Draft \*)] Flags permitted.
* 1 EXISTS
* 0 RECENT
* OK [UIDVALIDITY 1540728611] UIDs valid
* OK [UIDNEXT 5] Predicted next UID
HTB OK [READ-WRITE] Select completed (0.002 + 0.000 + 0.001 secs).
```

The `FETCH` command can be used to view the email headers. The number following the `FETCH` command specifies the message of interest.

```
HTB FETCH 1 (BODY[HEADER])
* 1 FETCH (BODY[HEADER] {349}
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: multipart/mixed;
 boundary="=_00b34a28b9033c43ed09c0950f4176e1"
Date: Sun, 28 Oct 2018 17:46:38 +0530
From: ayush <ayush@localhost>
To: undisclosed-recipients:;
Subject: service
Message-ID: <7203426a8678788517ce8d28103461bd@webmail.chaos.htb>
X-Sender: ayush@localhost
User-Agent: Roundcube Webmail/1.3.8

)
HTB OK Fetch completed (0.002 + 0.000 + 0.001 secs).
```

*Note: The `webmail.chaos.htb` subdomain is present in the `Message-ID` line within the header above. The Roundcube Webmail page can be accessed through `http://webmail.chaos.htb` after adding `10.10.10.120 webmail.chaos.htb` to the `/etc/hosts` file.*

To see what sort of information is present within the body of the email, another `FETCH` command was used.

```
HTB FETCH 1 (BODY)
* 1 FETCH (BODY (("text" "plain" ("charset" "US-ASCII" "format" "flowed") NIL NIL "7bit" 126 6)("application" "octet-stream" ("name" "enim_msg.txt") NIL NIL "base64" 372)("text" "x-python" ("charset" "us-ascii" "name" "en.py") NIL NIL "base64" 1100 14) "mixed"))
HTB OK Fetch completed (0.001 + 0.000 secs).
```

This output suggests that there are three parts included in the "body" of the email; a "US-ASCII" message that is 126 bytes, an "octet-stream" message that is base64 encoded and 372 bytes, and a "us-ascii" message that is base64 encoded and 1100 bytes. Using `FETCH` to read the first part reveals the following message:

```
HTB FETCH 1 (BODY[1])
* 1 FETCH (BODY[1] {126}
Hii, sahay
Check the enmsg.txt
You are the password XD.
Also attached the script which i used to encrypt.
Thanks,
Ayush
)
HTB OK Fetch completed (0.001 + 0.000 secs).
```

This suggests that the other two "body" segements of the email are the attachments `enmsg.txt` (shown as `enim_msg.txt` in the header) and a Python script (shown as `en.py` in the header). Also, the author of the message `Ayush` mentions to the recipient `sahay` that they (`sahay`) are the password or key for the encrtyped message.

The following `FETCH` command retrieves the first attachment, `enim_msg.txt`:

```
HTB FETCH 1 (BODY[2])
* 1 FETCH (BODY[2] {372}

HTB OK Fetch completed (0.001 + 0.000 secs).
```

The second attachment, `en.py` can be retrieved with a final `FETCH` command.

```
HTB FETCH 1 (BODY[3])
* 1 FETCH (BODY[3] {1100}

```

*Note: The entire email message could be read in one command using `HTB FETCH 1 BODY[]`*

After transferring the base64 encoded text to two separate files on the attacking system and removing the newline characters as well as the `)` character that terminates each base64 encoded string, the contents can be decoded using the `base64 -d` command.

```
root@kali:~/workspace/hackthebox/Chaos# base64 -d enim_msg.b64 > enim_msg.txt; base64 -d en.b64 > en.py
```

The data within `enim_msg.txt` is encrypted, and therefore is unintelligble. The email message from `ayush` mentions that `enim_msg.txt` was encrypted by the `en.py` "program" which is shown below.

```python
def encrypt(key, filename):
    chunksize = 64*1024
    outputFile = "en" + filename
    filesize = str(os.path.getsize(filename)).zfill(16)
    IV =Random.new().read(16)

    encryptor = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CBC, IV)

    with open(filename, 'rb') as infile:
        with open(outputFile, 'wb') as outfile:
            outfile.write(filesize.encode('utf-8'))
            outfile.write(IV)

            while True:
                chunk = infile.read(chunksize)

                if len(chunk) == 0:
                    break
                elif len(chunk) % 16 != 0:
                    chunk += b' ' * (16 - (len(chunk) % 16))

                outfile.write(encryptor.encrypt(chunk))

def getKey(password):
            hasher = SHA256.new(password.encode('utf-8'))
            return hasher.digest()
```
