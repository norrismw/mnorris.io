*Note: I completed this challenge on January 5th, 2019, however I'm just now writing it up in December 2019. As such, some of the details are sparse.*

## User
To begin enumeration, the `masscan` tool was used to scan the target system for open ports. 

```
root@kali:~/workspace/hackthebox/Ypuffy# masscan -e tun0 -p 1-65535 --rate 2000 10.10.10.107
   
```

This scan revealed that a variety of ports were open and listening for connections. Taking these open ports, the `nmap` tool was then used to further enumerate the open ports.

```
root@kali:~/workspace/hackthebox/Ypuffy# nmap -sC -sV -oA scans/discovered-tcp 10.10.10.150
