## User
To begin the enumeration process, a port scan was run against the target using `masscan`. The purpose of this intial scan is to quickly determine which ports are open so that a more focused `nmap` scan can be performed that will target only the open ports discovered by `masscan`.

```
root@kali:~/workspace/hackthebox/Access# masscan -e tun0 -p 1-65535 --rate 2000 10.10.10.117

```

From `masscan`, it was revealed that a variety of ports were listening for connections, as shown in the command output below.

```
root@kali:~/workspace/hackthebox/Irked# masscan -e tun0 -p 1-65535 --rate 2000 10.10.10.117

```

Using this information, a second scan was run using `nmap` to more thoughoughly examine the services listening on the discovered ports.

```
root@kali:~/workspace/hackthebox/Access# nmap -p 8067,65534,80,111,22,50167,6607 -sC -sV -oA scans/discovered-tcp 10.10.10.117
```

The results of the nmap scan revealed some interesting services listening on some uncommon ports, which suggest a good starting place for further enumeration. Note that in general, it is wise to take a broad approach during the initial enumeration process. That is to say that no single service should immediately be chosen and homed in on. Basic enumeration of each listening service should be completed before moving on to more focused enumeration of any particular service. In this write-up, the basic enumeration techniques are not discussed. A screenshot of the result of the nmap scan is shown below.

Of particular interest is the UnrealIRCd services running on TCP ports 8067 and 65534.

Lesser-known and outdated services are often vulnerable to exploitation. The `searchsploit` tool can be used to search for exploits relevant to a given service. The command shown below reveals multiple
