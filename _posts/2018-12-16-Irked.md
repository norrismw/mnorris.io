## User
To begin the enumeration process, a port scan was run against the target using `masscan`. The purpose of this intial scan is to quickly determine which ports are open so that a more focused `nmap` scan can be performed that will target only the open ports discovered by `masscan`.

```
root@kali:~/workspace/hackthebox/Access# masscan -e tun0 -p 1-65535 --rate 2000 10.10.10.117

```

From `masscan`, it was revealed that xxxx were listening for connections. Using this information, a second scan was run using `nmap` to more thoughoughly examine the services listening on the discovered ports.

```
root@kali:~/workspace/hackthebox/Access# nmap -p x,x,x -sC -sV -oA scans/discovered-tcp 10.10.10.117

```

As expected, the services listening for connections on Access were FTP, Telnet, and HTTP. A screenshot of the result of the `nmap` scan is shown below.
