*Note: I completed this challenge on January 12th, 2019, however I'm just now writing it up in December 2019. As such, some of the details are sparse.*

## User
To begin the enumeration process, a port scan was run against the target using `masscan`. The purpose of "this initial scan is to quickly determine which ports are open so that a more focused `nmap` scan can be performed that will target only the open ports discovered by `masscan`.

```
root@kali:~/workspace/hackthebox/Carrier# masscan -e tun0 -p 1-65535 --rate 2000 10.10.10.105

Starting masscan 1.0.5 (http://bit.ly/14GZzcT) at 2019-12-24 15:19:16 GMT

Discovered open port 22/tcp on 10.10.10.105  
...
```

From `masscan`, it was revealed that TCP ports 22(SSH) and 80(HTTP) were lisetning for connections. Using this information, a second scan was run using `nmap` to more thoughoughly examine the services listening on the discovered ports.

```

As expected, the service listening on port 22 is SSH and the service listening on port 80 is HTTP. 

At this time, an additional `nmap` scan was run on 100 UDP ports.

```

This scan reveals the SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) on UDP port 161.

Starting with TCP port 80, browsing to `http://10.10.10.105` directs the user to a "Lyghtspeed" login portal. 

![lyghtspeed_login.png](/assets/images/htb/carrier/lyghtspeed_login.png)

Interestingly enough, the page loads with some errors (`Error 45007` and `Error 45009`). The errors are present before interacting with the website in any way. Simple username password combinations were entered into the login form in an attempt to authenticate to the web application, but to no avail.

Continuing on, a `gobuster` scan was initiated in hopes of enumerating directories present on the webserver.

```
root@kali:~/workspace/hackthebox/Carrier# gobuster dir -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -u http://10.10.10.105
```

A variety of directories were discovered by `gobuster` shortly after the scan was launched.

```
/img (Status: 301)
/tools (Status: 301)
/doc (Status: 301)
/css (Status: 301)
/js (Status: 301)
/fonts (Status: 301)
/debug (Status: 301)
/server-status (Status: 403)
```

Enumerating these directories further revealed some interesting information. The `/img` directory is where the "Lyghtspeed" logo is stored and the `/tools` directory contains a `remote.php` file which suggests that the web server runs PHP code. The most interesting directory is `/doc` which contains two files; `diagram_for_tac.png` and `error_codes.pdf`.

The `diagram_for_tac.png` is a diagram that represents three routers that appear to belong to three different companies (perhaps ISPs); `Lyghtspeed Networks`, `Zaza Telecom`, and `CastCom`. Additionally, the diagram includes autonomous system numbers, or AS numbers for each company. As part of the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) routing protocol, ASNs are used to uniquely identify each network on the internet. 

![isp_diagram.png](/assets/images/htb/carrier/isp_diagram.png)

The `error_codes.pdf` document contains a two column table that provides a description for a variety of error codes, including the error codes `45007` and `45009` that were found on the Lyghtspeed login page.

![error_codes.png](/assets/images/htb/carrier/error_codes.png)

From this table, `Error 45007` is due to an invalid or expired license while `Error 45009` reports that system credentials have not been set, and that the default `admin` user's password is that of the chassis serial number.

Next, the `snmp_login` Metasploit module was used to attempt to login to the SNMP service on UDP port 161.

![snmp_login.png](/assets/images/htb/carrier/snmp_login.png)

Running the module with `run` results in the following output:

```
msf5 auxiliary(scanner/snmp/snmp_login) > run

[!] No active DB -- Credential data will not be saved!
[+] 10.10.10.105:161 - Login Successful: public (Access level: read-write); Proof (sysDescr.0): 
[*] Scanned 1 of 1 hosts (100% complete)
[*] Auxiliary module execution completed
```

This confirms that the SNMP service on UDP 161 is using the default `public` community, and that `read-write` permissions are set for the `public` community.

Further enumerating SNMP with the `snmpwalk` tool reveals the following information:

```
root@kali:~/workspace/hackthebox/Carrier# snmpwalk -v1 -c public 10.10.10.105
iso.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.11 = STRING: "SN#NET_45JDX23"
End of MIB
```

The `STRING: "SN#NET_45JDX23` output suggets a possible chassis serial number that could be the `admin` user's default password, as previously mentioned in the `error_codes.pdf` document.

Moving focus back to the Lyghtspeed login page, the application can be successfully authenticated to using the username/password combination of `admin` / `NET_45JDX23`. Once logged in, access to the dashboard, Lyghtspeed ticketing system, and diagnostics panel is granted.

There are a couple of interesting things to note here. First, taking a closer look at the notes accessible from the "Tickets" page reveals some potentially useful information. The content of the juciest note is shown below.

```
Rx / CastCom. IP Engineering team from one of our upstream ISP called to report a problem with some of their routes being leaked again due to a misconfiguration on our end. Update 2018/06/13: Pb solved: Junior Net Engineer Mike D. was terminated yesterday. Updated: 2018/06/15: CastCom. still reporting issues with 3 networks: 10.120.15,10.120.16,10.120.17/24's, one of their VIP is having issues connecting by FTP to an important server in the 10.120.15.0/24 network, investigating... Updated 2018/06/16: No prbl. found, suspect they had stuck routes after the leak and cleared them manually.
